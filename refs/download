__NAME__ description
The main function of this &glos-pragma; is to prevent any
interpolation of the output (see the &glos-interpolate; glossary entry).
It helps to preserve the downloads intact if they 
happen to contain constructs similar to
<literal>__<replaceable>VAR</replaceable>__</literal> 
or <literal>[tag]</literal>.
</para><para>
In practice, this pragma is only used internally. If
you wanted to make &IC; a content-delivery engine only, you could
set it in <filename>catalog.cfg</filename>, and only undefine it for a few
pages where you want standard page processing.
</para><para>
You might take a look at the <tag>deliver</tag> tag which uses this
pragma.
