__NAME__ description
The directive is used to emulate database "views" in database-based searches.
</para><para>
For each &glos-database; search, additional "filtering" will be performed
and only rows satisfying given condition will be returned. Commonly,
you will want to use something like <literal>owner=username</literal>, to
restrict searches to just rows that the corresponding users "own".
__END__

__NAME__ notes
&conf-TableRestrict; does not affect the text searches.
</para><para>
The directive may be useful in "mall" situations, where user is allowed to
only see products from the current store ID.

__NAME__ example: Restricting database searches to username
The following would prevent database searches from returning any records,
except those where the column <database class='field'>owner</database>
contains the current value of <code>[data session username]</code>.
<programlisting>
TableRestrict  products  owner=username
</programlisting>
As you can see from the ad-hoc example above, <literal>owner</literal> is a 
&glos-database; column name, and <literal>username</literal> is the key
from the session database. (The user's <code>[data session username]</code>
must match the value of the <database class='field'>owner</database> field
if a record is to be returned in a search operation).
__END__


__NAME__ example: Restricting edit to owned fields
&conf-TableRestrict; is also useful in embedded &PERL; code:
<programlisting>
[calc]
  # Restrict edit to owned fields
  $Config->{TableRestrict}{products} = 'owner=username';
  return;
[/calc]
</programlisting>
(Note that the above example works because value of the &conf-TableRestrict; 
config directive is overridden only for the duration of the current page &mdash;
for next page or access, &conf-TableRestrict; will again have the original
value).
__END__


__NAME__ example: Searching using SQL
When using SQL-based database searches, this directive in effect
turns the base search query of say,
<programlisting>
SELECT * FROM products
</programlisting>
into
<programlisting>
SELECT * FROM products WHERE owner = '[data session username]'
</programlisting>
