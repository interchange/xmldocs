__NAME__ description
For each new client connection, &IC; must spawn a new process that will 
handle communication with the client.
By using &conf-PreFork;, it is possible to <emphasis>pre-fork</emphasis>
(or in other words, "start ahead of time") some number of &IC; servers
that will be ready to serve client requests immediately as they come in.
</para><para>
This method reduces system overhead due to forking and is the fastest and
best way to run a busy &IC; server.
__END__

__NAME__ notes
Regardless of the &conf-PreFork; setting, each spawned server will serve
&conf-MaxRequestsPerChild; requests, before being shut down and respawned.
(This technique is used to prevent any memory leaks).

For an introduction to &IC; run modes and practical implications, please
see the &glos-ic-run-mode; glossary entry.
