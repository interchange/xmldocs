__NAME__ description
The directive simply specifies the number of <emphasis>dot-quads</emphasis>
the session qualifier will look at, if &conf-IpHead; is enabled.
</para><para>
In other words, with an IPV4 address (32 bit address, consisting of 
four dot-quads) of value
<systemitem class='ipadress'>127.0.0.1</systemitem> and &conf-IpQuad; of 
<literal>2</literal>, 
<systemitem class='ipadress'><emphasis role='bold'>127.0.</emphasis></systemitem>
would be enough to qualify the user session.

__NAME__ notes
&conf-DomainTail; is preferable unless one of your HTTP servers does not do
host name lookups.
