__NAME__ description
The directive simply specifies the number of <emphasis>dot-quads</emphasis>

In other words, with an IPv4 address (32 bit address, consisting of 
four dot-quads) of value
<systemitem class='ipadress'>127.0.0.1</systemitem> and &conf-IpQuad; of 
<literal>3</literal>, 
<systemitem class='ipaddress'><emphasis role='bold'>127.0.0.</emphasis></systemitem>
would be enough to qualify the user session.
