__NAME__ description
Specify list of &glos-configuration; directives whose values are to be made
available through the &glos-variable; space.
This allows you to conveniently
write say, <code>__<replaceable>DirectiveName</replaceable>__</code>, and 
retrieve the corresponding configuration directive's value.
</para><para>
To support &glos-scalar;s, &glos-array;s and &glos-hash;es of values (all
three basic &PERL; types), the syntax had to be extended a little. With 
array or hash &glos-configuration; directives, you need to append the index
number or hash key respectively.
See <xref linkend="AutoVariable_examples"/> for clarification.
</para><para>
Note that the behavior of &conf-__FILENAME__; is not dynamic &mdash; if need
to re-invoke &conf-__FILENAME__; every time you want to "refresh" the 
value visible through <code>__<replaceable>DirectiveName</replaceable>__</code>.
__END__


__NAME__ notes
The directive does not support &glos-hash; keys that contain non-word
characters or whitespace. Also, only the first-level of array and hash
indices/keys is translated properly.
