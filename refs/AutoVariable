__NAME__ description
Specify list of &glos-configuration; directives that are to be automatically
created as variable/value pairs. This allows you to conveniently
write say, <code>__<replaceable>DIRECTIVENAME</replaceable>__</code> and 
retrieve the corresponding configuration directive's value.
</para><para>
The above example, however, only works for scalar values. Since &IC; 
also supports &glos-array;s and &glos-hash;es of values (so, all three
basic &PERL; types), the syntax had to be extended a little. With 
array or hashes, you need to append the index number or hash key respectively.
See <xref linkend="AutoVariable_examples"/> for clarification.
__END__


__NAME__ notes
The directive does not support &glos-hash; keys that contain non-word
characters or whitespace. Also, only the first-level of array and hash
indices/keys is translated properly.
