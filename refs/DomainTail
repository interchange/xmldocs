__NAME__ description
The directive simply specifies that only the toplevel domain 
should be used in IP qualification for &glos-session; IDs.
If, for example, an IP was <literal>ri01-053.dialin.iskon.hr</literal>,
only <literal>iskon.hr</literal> would be used.

<para>
&IC; also supports taking various &ccTLD;s into account; 
see &conf-CountrySubdomains;.

TODO: how does this work with non-resolving stuff?

__NAME__ notes
This directive is a compromise on security, but it allows browsers that
do not accept cookies to use multiple proxy servers in the same domain.
Note that this directive is <emphasis role='bold'>enabled</emphasis>
by default.

If you are encrypting credit cards with PGP/GPG or using payment services,
then look at the &conf-WideOpen; directive, which
enables even more browser compatibility, again at the cost of even more
security.
