__NAME__ description
This directive affects &IC; behavior in conjunction with
&conf-PreFork;, by using one instead of two <function>fork()</function>
calls to prefork a server.
</para><para>
If you are running &IC; in prefork mode, you should use it in combination with
this directive. Only turn &conf-PreForkSingleFork; off if it causes zombie
processes to pile up on your system.
</para><para>
This method reduces system overhead when forking and is the fastest and
best way to run a busy &IC; server.
