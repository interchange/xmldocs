__NAME__ description
This directive affects &IC; behavior in conjunction with
&conf-PreFork;, ensuring the prefork code path is entirely
controllable by the value of &conf-PreFork;.
</para><para>
If you're running PreFork, you should use it in combination with
&conf-PreForkSingleFork;, to create the absolute minimal number of forks
necessary. Only turn &conf-PreForkSingleFork; off 
if it causes zombie processes to pile up.
</para><para>
This method reduces system overhead due to forking and is the fastest and
best way to run a busy &IC; server.
