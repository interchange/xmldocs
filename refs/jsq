__NAME__ example: Basic example
Here's an example of JavaScript code and the output it would generate,
once expanded by Interchange:
<programlisting><![CDATA[
<script>
  var astring = 'just an insert';
  var somevar = [jsq] Big long string you don't
  want to have to quote for JS, and you want to
  insert the variable $astring.[/jsq];
</script>
]]></programlisting>
Expands to:
<programlisting><![CDATA[
<script>
var astring = 'just an insert';
var somevar = " Big long string you don't" +
  '  want to have to quote for JS, and you want to' +
  '  insert the variable ' + astring + '.';
</script>
]]></programlisting>
__END__
