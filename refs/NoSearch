__NAME__ description
Specify database names or globs that will be matched against the databases
used in any attempted search.
You may separate multiple match strings with whitespace, and may include
shell-style wildcards (globs).
</para><para>
The default setting is <literal>userdb</literal>, which
means that, by default, you cannot use &IC;-style searches on the
<database>userdb</database> table.

__NAME__ notes
This directive only disables &IC; file/database-based searches; pure SQL
searches still work.
__END__

__NAME__ example: Defining NoSearch
Disable searching on <database>userdb</database>, and other databases
beginning with "<literal>.</literal>" or ending in "<literal>.secret</literal>".
<programlisting>
NoSearch userdb  .*  *.secret
</programlisting>

__NAME__ example: Overriding __FILENAME__ setting on a specific page
<programlisting><![CDATA[
[calc] $Config->{NoSearch} = '' [/calc]
]]></programlisting>
For a discussion on why this example works (and works per-page), see
&glos-configuration; glossary entry.
