__NAME__ description
&IC; determines the appropriate catalog to invoke by the 
<literal>SCRIPT_NAME</literal> from the CGI call. This means that different
(possibly virtual) hosts cannot use the same <literal>SCRIPT_NAME</literal>, as
the catalogs would become indistinguishable. Set this directive to enable
differentiation performed on the hostname as well.

See the &conf-Catalog; directive for more on the subject and concrete
examples.

__NAME__ notes
If &conf-FullUrl; is defined, <emphasis role='bold'>all> catalogs must be
defined with hostnames included</emphasis>. Per-catalog setting will not work,
as this is used before the catalog name is known.
