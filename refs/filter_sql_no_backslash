__NAME__ description
This &glos-pragma; disables default backslash &glos-escape;s performed by
the &filter-sql; filter.
</para><para>
For databases like &MYSQL; or &PGSQL; which treat <literal>\</literal> in 
a special way, the default behavior of escaping backslashes is the right choice.
</para><para>
The &glos-SQL; standard, however, does not treat <literal>\</literal>
specially, so you would want to enable this &glos-pragma; (effectively
disabling escaping) for conforming databases, such as &ORACLE;.
