__NAME__ description
This directive enables the "discount spaces" feature.
</para><para>
When &conf-DiscountSpacesOn; is enabled, then on a per-page
before-&glos-autoload; basis, this routine initializes the
current discount space to '<literal>main</literal>', and then checks
all &glos-CGI; variables defined with the &conf-DiscountSpaceVar;
configuration directive to see if an alternate discount space has
been specified.
</para><para>
When &conf-DiscountSpacesOn; is not enabled, then the behavior is
compatible to how it was before the feature was added to &IC; &mdash;
all "discount space" functions become a no-operation; any attempts
to specify an alternate discount space will have no effect, and will
result in an error message in the &glos-catalog;'s error log.

See glossary entry &glos-discount; for a complete discussion.
