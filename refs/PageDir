__NAME__ example: Setting PageDir depending on current locale
To use a different page directory for different locales, say French and 
English, help yourself with the robust &conf-Locale; directive:
<programlisting>
# Establish the default at startup
PageDir   english

# Establish locale-dependent directories
Locale fr_FR  PageDir  francais
Locale en_US  PageDir  english
</programlisting>
To fully understand the example and implicitly presented &IC; features, make
sure you're familiar with &glos-internationalization; and &glos-locale;
glossary
entries.
