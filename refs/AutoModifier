__NAME__ description
The directive specifies names of the product &glos-attribute;s 
which should be automatically loaded from a database column.
</para><para>
In other words, 
when an item is added to the shopping cart using &IC;'s routines, the
attributes declared in &conf-AutoModifier; will be set to the values of the
fields in the <database>products</database> database.
</para><para>
This facility will often be used in determining pricing, shipping,
or other custom product attributes. These attributes will probably
be used in a custom &PERL; code which will scan the items in the electronic
&glos-cart; and make decisions.
</para><para>
There are several forms of the specification. The simplest is
a field with no table specification:
<programlisting>
	AutoModifier heavy
</programlisting>
This one has a bit of "magic" associated. To account for matrix-option
products, the various product tables are searched, for both the item
code and the base SKU associated with the item.
</para><para>
You can also rename the attribute to something different than the
field:
<programlisting>
	AutoModifier heavy=heavy_item
</programlisting>
This would place the contents of the "heavy_item" field in the
"heavy" attribute.
</para><para>
If you want to use a non-products table to load the modifier, you
specify it in the usual Interchange colon-separated syntax:
<programlisting>
	AutoModifier extra:heavy
</programlisting>
This would look in the <database>extra</database> table for the
"heavy" field.
</para><para>
You can also specify that another attribute holds the key for
the modifier:
	AutoModifier extra:heavy:category
</programlisting>
This would look in the <database>extra</database> table for the
"heavy" field, using the "category" attribute in the item as
the key.

__NAME__ notes
This can useful when doing shipping calculations or in embedded
&PERL; code that works on item attributes.

__NAME__ example: Specifying AutoModifier
To set whether an item is defined as "heavy" and requires truck shipment, or
is "downloadable", set:
<programlisting>
AutoModifier heavy downloadable
</programlisting>
Also make sure to have the
<database class='field'>heavy</database> and 
<database class='field'>downloadable</database> columns defined in your 
<database>products</database> database.
</para><para>
Example: to set the heavy attribute from the 
<database class='table'>inventory</database> table with the same
key as the product code, do:
<programlisting>
AutoModifier inventory:heavy
</programlisting>
</para><para>
Example: to set the heavy attribute from the <database
class='field'>heavy</database> field in the <database
class='table'>inventory</database> table with the same key as the product
code, do:
<programlisting>
AutoModifier inventory:heavy
</programlisting>
</para><para>
Example: to set the "weighty" attribute from the <database
class='field'>heavy</database> field in the <database
class='table'>inventory</database> table with the same key as the product
code, do:
<programlisting>
AutoModifier weighty=inventory:heavy
</programlisting>
</para><para>
Example: to set the heavy attribute from the <database
class='field'>heavy</database> field in the <database
class='table'>inventory</database> table with the the 
base SKU for a variant, do:
<programlisting>
AutoModifier inventory:heavy:mv_sku
</programlisting>
