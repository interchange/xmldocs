__NAME__ description
The directive specifies names of the product &glos-attribute;s 
which should be automatically loaded from table columns.
Table, column and key identifiers belonging to a single specification
are separated by a colon (<literal>:</literal>), while multiple specifications
are separated by whitespace.
</para><para>
In other words, 
when an item is added to the shopping cart using &IC;'s routines, the
attributes declared in &conf-AutoModifier; will be set to the values of the
fields in the <database>products</database> database.
</para><para>
This facility will often be employed in determining product
&glos-price;, &glos-discount;, &glos-tax; and &glos-shipping;, and 
other custom attributes; these attributes will probably
be used in custom &PERL; code that will scan the electronic
&glos-cart; contents and perform decisions. For example, by defining
columns <database class='field'>heavy</database> and
<database class='field'>downloadable</database>, you will be
able to perform decisions
based on <code>$item-&gt;{heavy}</code> and
<code>$item-&gt;{downloadable}</code> (but there are more access methods,
see the &glos-attribute; &GE;).

<!-- TODO
This one has a bit of "magic" associated. To account for matrix-option
products, the various product tables are searched, for both the item
code and the base SKU associated with the item.
-->

__NAME__ notes
This can useful when doing shipping calculations or in embedded
&PERL; code that works on item attributes.
</para><para>
See &glos-attribute; for a complete introduction to item attributes.

__NAME__ example: Specifying AutoModifier
To set whether an item is defined as "heavy" and requires truck shipment, or
is "downloadable", set:
<programlisting>
AutoModifier heavy downloadable
</programlisting>
<para>
Also make sure to have the
<database class='field'>heavy</database> and 
<database class='field'>downloadable</database> columns defined in your 
<database>products</database> database.
