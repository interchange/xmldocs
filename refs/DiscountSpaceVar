__NAME__ description
&conf-DiscountSpaceVar; is a configuration directive with the 
default value of '<literal>mv_discount_space</literal>'. It is a list of
names of &glos-CGI; variables to check per page process, such that a &glos-CGI;
variable can be used to specify the discount space.
</para><para>
For this directive to have any effect, the &conf-DiscountSpacesOn; directive
must be enabled.
</para><para>
The default value, <mv>mv_discount_space</mv>, 
is likely to suffice for most purposes, but people could want to tie the
discount space
to other things, such as the &glos-cart; name, by including other variable
names in
this array (for instance, <literal>mv_cartname</literal> would tie the
discount space to the cart name, which could be convenient in some situations).
