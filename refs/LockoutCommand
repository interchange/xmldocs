__NAME__ synopsis
<group choice='req'>
	<arg choice='plain'><replaceable>command</replaceable></arg>
</group>
__END__


__NAME__ description
The directive specifies the command (as it would be entered from the shell)
that will somehow prevent the remote IP from accessing the &IC; catalog, or
the whole system.
</para><para>
The IP address will be substituted for the first occurrence of the string
<literal>%s</literal> (which might remind you of <function>printf</function>
format specifiers). The command will be executed under the &IC; user ID,
so you'll have to fine-tune the system privileges, or use 
<command>sudo</command>-like tools.
__END__

__NAME__ notes
A script could be written which would modify the appropriate access control
files, such as <filename>.htaccess</filename> (Web server-level)
or <filename>/etc/hosts.deny</filename> (TCP Wrappers-level), to do another
level of lockout.
</para><para>
Even a simple command line along the lines of
<userinput>perl -0777 -npi -e 's/deny/deny from %s\ndeny/'
/path/to/cgi-bin/.htaccess</userinput>
would work as well.
