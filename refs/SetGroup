__NAME__ description
By default, the &IC; server and the individual catalogs it serves
run under the same Unix user ID and user group (UID and GID).
</para><para>
This directive allows you to switch group at the catalog level.
However, this approach has its drawbacks. First of all, the &IC; user
must already be a member of the target group, that is &mdash; have the
target group in its list of secondary groups. Verify that using the
<command>id <replaceable>USERNAME</replaceable></command> command.
Another, related problem is of a more technical nature. Namely, most
operating systems limit the number of secondary groups per user;
on Linux, this limit is <literal>32</literal> groups (run 
<command>grep -r NGROUPS_MAX /usr/include/</command> to verify).
This means that you cannot develop a generic site scheme based on
&conf-SetGroup; if you plan to serve more than 30 catalogs, or
switch between more than 30 groups.
</para><para>
One viable solution is to either run separate &IC; daemons (each 
serving 30 catalogs), or give each catalog user it's own &IC;
server. The latter is beneficial in terms of tighter access control and
greater user freedom, and is a generally acceptable approach.
