<group choice='req'>
	<arg choice='plain'><replaceable>field_name</replaceable></arg>
</group>
__END__


__NAME__ description
By default, &IC; expects item price to be in the 
<database class='field'>price</database> field in the database.
This directive allows modification of the default name.
</para><para>
The field is accessed implicitly when you call say, 
<code>[item-price]</code> in &glos-ITL;.
__END__


__NAME__ notes
The existence of the field is not exactly crucial, but it's important
for say, &glos-flypage;s.
</para><para>
It's also useful to set the directive based on current &glos-locale;.

__NAME__ example: Redefining PriceField
<programlisting>
PriceField cijena
</programlisting>
"Cijena", for example, is a croatian equivalent of "price".
__END__

__NAME__ example: Setting PriceField depending on current locale
<programlisting>
# Establish the default at startup
PriceField    price

# Establish locale-specific price field
Locale fr_FR  PriceField  prix
</programlisting>
Just by the way, if &conf-PriceBreaks; is enabled, the
<database class='field'>prix</database> field from the
<database>pricing</database> database will be used to develop quantity-based
pricing.

To fully understand the example and implicitly presented &IC; features, make
