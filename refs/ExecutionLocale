<group choice='req'>

</group>
__END__


__NAME__ description
The directive specifies the "lowest-level" &glos-locale;; the one that
will be re-set on every page so that the daemon cannot even accidentally be
left with a bad locale.
__END__

__NAME__ example: Defining ExecutionLocale
Put the following in &gcf;:
<programlisting>
ExecutionLocale de_DE
</programlisting>
__END__


__NAME__ notes
&conf-ExecutionLocale; defaults to "<literal>C</literal>" and you'll probably
never want to change it. There <emphasis>is</emphasis> the need to change
locale while &IC; is 
running, of course, but this is done only for critical code sections and not
for the majority of other, "locale-independent" code.
To see the list of code "groups" that require a locale adjustment, run
<command>locale</command> and <command>man locale</command> on your Unix
system.
