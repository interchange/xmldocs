__NAME__ description
Specify extension (suffix) to use with filenames when looking for the
source files in the <filename class='directory'>pages/</filename> directory.
</para><para>
If a page with the configured suffix does not exist on the disk, &IC; will
unconditionally try the usual "<literal>.html</literal>" variant.
</para><para>
Note that 
this setting applies strictly to the disk file lookup &mdash;
page names in the users' browsers will always appear as
"<literal>.html</literal>".
__END__


__NAME__ notes
The way &IC; looks for pages is &glos-locale;-sensitive. Besides the default
HTML suffix which is set using this &conf-HTMLsuffix; directive, you can 
set locale-dependent suffixes using &conf-Locale;.
