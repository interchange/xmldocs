Watch out for parse order with <tag>tag pragma</tag> or <tag>restrict</tag> when used with lists that retrieve data from the database (such as <tag>PREFIX-*</tag>, <tag>loop</tag>, or the flypage). Loops parse before regular tags like <tag>tag</tag>, and are thus not affected by them (so you must include the whole loop code in the "critical section").
