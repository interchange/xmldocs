By default, Interchange does not allow data returned from databases to be reparsed for Interchange tags (all the &#91;s are converted to an entity "&amp;#91;"). Setting this pragma eliminates the restriction and passes &#91;s through for interpolation).

If you want to have tags in your database and display them in Interchange pages (to say, display <tag>page</tag> links for catalog-internal hyperlinks in your product descriptions), you need to enable the <pragma>safe_data</pragma> pragma.
Some things to consider, though:
</para><para>
It might be better to use the <option>safe_data</option> attribute available to certain tags, or perhaps the <tag>pragma</tag> for a whole page or <tag>tag pragma safe_data</tag><tag>/tag</tag> for a small block of ITL code on a page, instead of setting a catalog-wide <pragma>safe_data</pragma> pragma.
</para><para>
In any case, it is strongly recommended that you surround the area in a <tag>restrict</tag> tag to only allow a specific set of tags to appear "in-band" (which should be relatively safe), such as <tag>page</tag> or <tag>area</tag>. Expect security compromises if you allow <tag>calc</tag>, <tag>perl</tag> or any other extremely powerful tags.

Be certain that you absolutely know where the data from your databases will be used. Will it always be possible to reparse for tags? What about when it's used to create an e-mailed plain-text receipt? Will a literal "<tag>page </tag>" tag show up in the product description on the receipt? Would the desired output of &lt;a href="..."&gt; be any better in a plaintext situation? What if you access your database from applications other than Interchange? You'll then have to decide what to do with such tags; perhaps you can simply strip them, but will the missing tag output cause you any trouble?
</para><para>
To sum up, <pragma>safe_data</pragma> is disabled by default for a reason, and you should be very careful if you decide to enable it.
