__NAME__ description
The directive specifies one or more &glos-filter;s
that should automatically be applied to &glos-CGI;
&glos-variable;s.
</para><para>
That way, by the time you get to call &tag-cgi;, the 
variable value is already filtered and ready for use.

__NAME__ example: Automatically filtering "mail_lists" variable
Some variables submitted by the user come back null-separated, such as 
values from multi-select boxes where the selected items are separated
by null (<literal>\0</literal>) characters. To automatically change those
nulls to spaces, you could use this directive:
<programlisting><![CDATA[
Filter mail_lists  null_to_space
]]></programlisting>
__END__

__NAME__ example: Appling multiple filters to a variable
<programlisting><![CDATA[
Filter firstname  "lc ucfirst"
]]></programlisting>
__END__


__NAME__ notes
You could also use the &tag-filter; tag to help yourself, but in the long
run the &conf-Filter; approach reduces typing and minimizes the chance
of omission.

__NAME__ missing
More examples
It filters only CGI vars, right?
