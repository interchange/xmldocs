__NAME__ description
The directive assigns one or more (comma separated) &glos-filter;s
that should be automatically applied to a variable.
__END__


__NAME__ example: Automatically filtering "mail_lists" variable
Some variables submitted by the user come back null-separated, such as 
values from multi-select boxes where the selected items are separated
by null (<literal>\0</literal>) characters. To automatically change those
nulls to spaces, you could use this directive:
<programlisting><![CDATA[
Filter mail_lists  null_to_space
]]></programlisting>
__END__


__NAME__ notes
You could also use the &tag-filter; tag to help yourself, but in the long
run the &conf-Filter; approach reduces typing and minimizes the chance
of omission.
__END__

__NAME__ missing
Comma-separated list when multiple filters, right? Can't be space, it'd split into directive=value pair.
