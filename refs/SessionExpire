__NAME__ description
It is the nature of the WWW that a customer can close the browser program, or
leave your catalog at any time, without making your Web server aware of the
fact. The only way we can reach the conclusion ourselves is to detect the
the lack of further requests from the client (clients are identified by
session IDs).
</para><para>
Old session information needs to be periodically expired. &conf-SessionExpire;
specifies the minimum of time to keep track of session information.
__END__

__NAME__ notes
If &conf-CookieLogin; is enabled, &conf-SessionExpire; can be a small value.
If the customer's browser has the &IC; session cookie stored, he or she will
be automatically logged back in with the next request. Note, however, that
the customer's cart and session values will be reset.

__NAME__ example: Setting SessionExpire
