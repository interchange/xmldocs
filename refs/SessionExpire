__NAME__ description
Website visitors can close their browser or move to browsing other sites
without making the Web server aware of the fact.<sbr/>
This is a potential problem as new sessions would keep getting created,
but they'd never be removed, wasting system resources.<sbr/>
The way we can detect "closed" &glos-session;s is by measuring time
between user requests. We can expire sessions where no activity was
registered for more than the specified maximum interval.
</para><para>
&conf-__FILENAME__; specifies the maximum amount of time for which the
session information is preserved between two consecutive user requests.
__END__

__NAME__ notes
If &conf-CookieLogin; is enabled, &conf-SessionExpire; can be a small value.
If the customer's browser has the &IC; session cookie stored, he or she will
be automatically logged back in with the next request. Note, however, that
the customer's cart and session values will be reset.

__NAME__ example: Setting SessionExpire

</programlisting>
