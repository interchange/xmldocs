__NAME__ description
The directive specifies filenames that contain search
&glos-profile; definitions.
</para><para>
An unlimited number of search &glos-profile;s
can be set up, performing complex searches on a
single user click. At the same time, separately-defined search profiles
keep your &glos-HTML; pages cleaner.
</para><para>
As said, 
multiple profiles can be defined, and within the same file.
In that case, profiles must be separated by <literal>__END__</literal>
tokens. Each opening <literal>__NAME__</literal> token should be left-aligned,
and each <literal>__END__</literal> should be on a line by itself,
with no leading or trailing whitespace.
