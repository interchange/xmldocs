__NAME__ description
Just like &conf-Require; or &conf-Suggest;, this directive checks for
a capability, but unlike the first two it never causes a
warning or other message. This allows a module to be loaded if available
and a program can later check for the capability and dynamically adapt to the
configuration.
</para><para>
"Capabilities" you can check for are
<literal>globalsub</literal>,
<literal>sub</literal>,  
<literal>taggroup</literal>,
<literal>usertag</literal> and
<literal>module</literal> .
