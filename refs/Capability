__NAME__ description
Just like &conf-Require; or &conf-Suggest;, this directive checks for
a feature or capability, but unlike the first two it never causes a
warning or other message. This allows a module to be loaded if available
and a program can later check for the capability and dynamically adapt to the
configuration.
