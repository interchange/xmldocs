&SYNOPSIS_YESNO;
__END__

__NAME__ description
The directive specifies whether the <literal>X-Track</literal> HTTP header
is issued to clients when the user &glos-tracking; feature is enabled.
</para><para>
To disable the feature, do not specify &conf-__FILENAME__; in your config
file at all. Otherwise, the feature will be enabled and will control the
said <literal>X-Track</literal> header.
__END__

__NAME__ notes
Starting with Interchange 5.5.2, the behavior of &conf-__FILENAME__; is
as described. Previously, there was no option to disable the
<literal>X-Track</literal> HTTP header, and this option controlled
whether user &glos-tracking; was enabled or not.
