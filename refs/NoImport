__END__


__NAME__ synopsis
<group choice='req'>
	<arg choice='plain' rep='repeat'><replaceable>table_name</replaceable></arg>
</group>
__END__


__NAME__ description
The directive specifies &glos-database; tables that should not be 
re-imported from the text source files. The database would then be
re-imported only on critical events, such as 
<filename><replaceable>table</replaceable>.gdbm</filename> being deleted.
__END__

__NAME__ notes
The import would ordinarily happen when a change in appropriate
text source file is detected, &IC; is (re)started, or the catalog
is reconfigured.
</para><para>
This setting is useful for &glos-SQL; databases used by other applications
besides &IC;, or large databases you load and back up outside of Interchange.
With this option, you can omit text source files for databases entirely.

__NAME__ example: Disabling 'products' and 'inventory' table import
Put the following in &gcf;:
<programlisting>
NoImport products inventory
</programlisting>
