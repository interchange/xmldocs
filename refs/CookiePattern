__NAME__ description
The directive sets the regular expression that &IC; will use to extract
the session ID out of the client browser's &glos-cookie;.
__END__

__NAME__ notes
By default, &IC; cookie planted in user's browser consists of 
a session ID followed by a colon followed by an IP address, username
or domain name.
__END__

__NAME__ example: Setting CookiePattern
The default regular expression pattern used for &conf-CookiePattern;
might work sometimes, but I find it unsuitable if you just want to change
the &conf-CookieName;, because it then breaks the usual behavior.
Here's a better value for common setups:
<programlisting>
CookiePattern \w{8,32}
</programlisting>
In general, however, you should only modify &conf-CookiePattern; default
value if you somehow change the <emphasis role='bold'>content</emphasis>
that &IC; stores in browser cookies (by say, letting other program create
the cookie).

TODO: Seems it needs CookiePattern to work, but currently the whole
thing is a little broken
