__NAME__ description
The option should be enabled to indicate (an unfortunate) situation where
&IC; is running on Microsoft Windows family of products.
</para><para>
However, Unix is best. The Windows version, while perhaps more than just a toy,
is not suitable for high-volume catalog serving. This is mostly due to Windows
NT not fitting the UNIX <function>fork()</function> model which works so well
with &IC;.
</para><para>
On Microsoft Windows, you will want to stop and re-start your &IC; server at
least once per day. You can use a system agent to automate it &mdash; you will
want to stop the server to expire the session database anyway. You need to do
this because &IC; requires the Unix-specific <function>fork()</function> call
to spawn multi-tasked
servers, and without multi-tasked servers there is a strong possibility of
a memory leak &mdash; especially if you use embedded &PERL; or conditional tags.

__NAME__ notes
&IC; support for Microsoft Windows support has been abandoned.
This configuration directive has no purpose; if you think you need it,
think twice.
