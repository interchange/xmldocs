__NAME__ description
The directive specifies whether to prevent commands and tags (such as 
&tag-file;) to read absolute filenames (any files) on the system.
In cases where the &IC; daemon has no permission to read the file , this
directive &mdash; of course &mdash; has no influence.
</para><para>
This should be enabled in multiuser environments to minimize security
problems.

__NAME__ notes
Note that this does not apply to tests for whether a file exists (as one
would do with <code>[if file ...]</code> or similar). Such operations are
allowed regardless of &conf-NoAbsolute;.

__NAME__ example: Enabling NoAbsolute
Put the following in &gcf;:
<programlisting>
NoAbsolute Yes
</programlisting>
