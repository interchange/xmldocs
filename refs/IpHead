__NAME__ description
The directive affects the domain/IP session qualifying method. When enabled,
only the first &conf-IpQuad; dot-quads of the IP address are used to qualify
the user session (along with, of course, the session ID).

This is a slight compromise on security, but it allows
non-cookie-accepting browsers, like AOL's V2.0, to use multiple proxy
servers.

__NAME__ notes
&conf-DomainTail; is preferable unless one of your HTTP servers does not do
host name lookups.
