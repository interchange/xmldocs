__NAME__ description
By default, &IC; expects the item description to be in the 
<database class='field'>description</database> field in the database.
This directive allows modification of the default name.
</para><para>
The field is accessed implicitly when you call say, 
<code>[item-description]</code> in &glos-ITL;.
__END__


__NAME__ notes
The existence of the field is not exactly crucial, but it's important
for say, &glos-flypage;s.
</para><para>
It's also useful to set the directive value based on &glos-locale;.

TODO: Clarify this? "If there is an
attribute set to the same name as C<DescriptionField>, this will be used for
display."


__NAME__ example: Redefining DescriptionField
<programlisting>
DescriptionField opis
</programlisting>
"Opis", for example, is a croatian equivalent of "description".
__END__

__NAME__ example: Setting DecriptionField depending on current locale
<programlisting>
# Establish the default at startup
DecriptionField    description

# Establish locale-specific description field
Locale fr_FR  DecriptionField  desc_fr
</programlisting>
To fully understand the example and implicitly presented &IC; features, make
