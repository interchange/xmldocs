__NAME__ description
By default, &IC; expects the product description to be in the 
<database class='field'>description</database> field in the
<database>products</database> database.
This directive allows modification of the default name.
</para><para>
The field is accessed implicitly when you call say, 
<code>[item-description]</code> in &glos-ITL;.
__END__


__NAME__ notes
It's useful to set this directive based on &glos-locale;,
allowing for locale-specific product descriptions.

TODO: Clarify this? "If there is an
attribute set to the same name as C<DescriptionField>, this will be used for
display."


__NAME__ example: Redefining DescriptionField

__NAME__ example: Setting DecriptionField depending on current locale
<programlisting>
# Establish the default at startup

</programlisting>
To fully understand the example and implicitly presented &IC; features, make
