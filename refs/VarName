__NAME__ notes
&IC; already ships with some remapping definitions (to shorten URLs, not
obfuscate code or anything); see <filename>etc/varnames</filename> for a
list.

When remapping <literal>mv_</literal> variable names, make sure you avoid
two-letter abbreviations &mdash; most are reserved for the
<olink targetdoc='search'>search</olink> parameters. Names consisting of
1, 3 or more characters would be fine, though.
