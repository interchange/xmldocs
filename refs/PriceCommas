__NAME__ description
The directive specifies whether <literal>mon_thousands_sep</literal>

for display.

If no commas are desired in price numbers (for the &tag-item-price; tag etc.),

a comma ("<literal>,</literal>") but a proper &glos-locale;-equivalent of it.

This directive is overriden by eventual
