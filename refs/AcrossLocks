__NAME__ description
All configured &glos-database;s are opened every time an &IC; page is
visited and enters processing. Opening a new database connection takes
time, so &IC; provides fast dummy pointer to each database until the
database is actually used within the page.
</para><para>
Enabling this directive has the effect of disabling fast pointers
and always opening real &glos-database;s.
