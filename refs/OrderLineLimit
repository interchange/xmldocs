__NAME__ description
Specify maximum number of items that the user is allowed to place in the
shopping cart.
</para><para>
Some poorly-mannered robots may "attack" a site by following
all links one after another. Some even ignore any
<filename>robots.txt</filename> file that may have been created. If one of
these bad robots orders several dozen or more items, the time required to
save and restore the shopping cart from the user session may become excessive.
</para><para>
When the &conf-OrderLineLimit; is 
exceeded, the command defined in &conf-LockoutCommand;  will be executed and
the shopping cart will be emptied.

__NAME__ notes
Set the directive to a number greater than the number of line items a user
is ever expected to order.
