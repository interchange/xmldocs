__NAME__ description
The directive instructs &IC; to fetch code blocks "on-demand" from the
&conf-CodeRepository; instead of starting up with everything.
</para><para>
So, at runtime, when particular functionality is needed but is not
yet present in the running &IC; installation, it is copied from 
&conf-CodeRepository; to 
<filename class='directory'>$Global::TagDir/Accumulated/</filename>
<emphasis role='bold'>and automatically activated</emphasis>.
Later, when you restart &IC; the next time, these code blocks will be
found in the accumulated directory and loaded normally
(there will be no need to fetch them from &conf-CodeRepository;
again).
</para><para>
Over time, as you access pages and routines, a full set of tags
will be copied to the accumulated directory, and you will then be
able to turn &conf-AccumulateCode; off.
(In fact, &conf-AccumulateCode; is recommended for development and should 
really be turned off in production systems).
