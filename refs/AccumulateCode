__NAME__ description
The directive instructs &IC; to fetch code blocks "on-demand" from the
&conf-CodeRepository;, instead of starting up with everything.
</para><para>
So, at runtime, when particular functionality is needed but is not
yet present in the running &IC; installation, it is copied from 
&conf-CodeRepository; to 
<filename class='directory'>$Global::TagDir/Accumulated/</filename>.
When you restart &IC; the next time, these code blocks will be found,
read normally and need not be recompiled on the fly again.
</para><para>
Over time, as you access pages and routines, a full set of tags
will be developed and you can then disable &conf-AccumulateCode;.
(Infact, &conf-AccumulateCode; is recommended for development and should 
really be turned off in production systems).
