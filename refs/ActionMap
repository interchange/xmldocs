__NAME__ description
The directive allows the definition of Interchange &glos-ActionMap;s, whose
contents are usually &PERL; subroutines.
</para><para>
The leading part of the incoming page path is taken and checked if it represents
a valid action. If it does, the action name itself will be stripped from the
path, and the appropriate action will be called with the rest of the argument.

__NAME__ notes
For an introduction to Action Maps, see &glos-ActionMap; glossary entry.

__NAME__ example: Ignoring the Order action
Put the following in &ccf;:
<programlisting>
ActionMap order sub { 1 }
</programlisting>
Since we effectively turned Order into a no-operation action, the usual
order link such as
<code><![CDATA[<A HREF="[area order/nextpage]">Go to the next page</A>]]></code>
would be equivalent to <code><![CDATA[[page order/nextpage]Go to the next page</a>]]></code>.

__NAME__ missing
In the example, I provided some erroneous comment.
Also fix description and add synopsis
