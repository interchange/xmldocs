__NAME__ description
Defines the name of an external program which will be invoked
to check the generated page &glos-HTML; code for correctness
(<command>/usr/bin/weblint</command>, for example).
</para><para>
Note that you need to put <code>[flag checkhtml]</code> on your page, 
(or wrap only a block of HTML code to check in
<code>[tag flag checkhtml]...[/tag]</code>)
to trigger the actual invocation of the specified external command.
</para><para>
The output of the HTML checker program will be included in the
output page, so you might want to wrap it in HTML comments
(&lt;!-- ... --&gt;). Then you can check it out by viewing the HTML
page source in your browser.
</para><para>
If you want a quick way to enable or disable this feature, without 
modifying each HTML page individually, put <code>__CHECK_HTML__</code> 
on every page (or ideally, in a template). Then, to enable the
checker, define <code>Variable CHECK_HTML [flag checkhtml]</code> in
&gcf;. To disable it, leave the variable value empty.

__NAME__ notes
Leaving this directive enabled on a production server usually leads to
unneccesary performance degradation. The additional process spawn
(and the time it takes to complete) every time a page is visited is
very costly.

Additionally, this directive currently appears to be broken 
(it simply never gets called).
