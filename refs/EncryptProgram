__NAME__ description
Specify default encryption program, and a template to call it. The encryption
program will be called to perform tasks such as encrypting credit card
numbers (<emphasis role='bold'>if</emphasis> they are stored on the server).
</para><para>
Two placeholders can be used, <literal>%p</literal> and 
<literal>%f</literal>. At encryption time, the former expands to a password,
the latter one to a temporary file name.
</para><para>
If &IC; can found a variant of <command>gpg</command>/<command>pgp</command>
on your system, it is the default. Setting of <literal>none</literal> disables
encryption.

__NAME__ notes
This directive is different from &conf-PGP;, which is used to encrypt
<emphasis>complete</emphasis> orders and not just part of their contents.
</para><para>
If the order &conf-Route; method of sending orders is used (default in the
&std-catalog; demo), then this directive sets the default value of
the <literal>encrypt_program</literal> attribute.
