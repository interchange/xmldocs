__NAME__ notes
This directive is obsolete as of &IC; 5.5.0, and the behavior is
as if <code>ConfigParseComments No</code> was specified.

__NAME__ description
When disabled (set to <literal>No</literal>), 
configuration meta-directives such as 
<literal>#include</literal>,
<literal>#ifdef</literal> and
<literal>#ifndef</literal>,
are treated as pure comments with no specific meaning.
</para><para>
However, since those were originally borrowed from the C preprocessor,
and, true to their C heritage, they started with an '<literal>#</literal>'
(hash) character in &IC; versions up to and including 4.6.
</para><para>
This was inconvenient for newcomers who were easily misguided by thinking
those were just comments, so Interchange versions 4.7 and up were changed
to use the meta-directives <emphasis role='bold'>without the hash
prefix</emphasis>.

__NAME__ example: Config parser behavior with ConfigParseComments disabled
<programlisting>
ConfigParseComments No

#include comment
# This, and the above line, are pure comments.

# You better prepare the file named 'comment' for the following one:
include comment
</programlisting>
