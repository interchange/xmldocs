__NAME__ notes
This directive is obsolete as of &IC; 5.5.0, and the behavior is
as if <code>ConfigParseComments Yes</code> was specified.

__NAME__ description
When disabled (set to <literal>No</literal>), 
configuration meta-directives such as 
<literal>#include</literal>,
<literal>#ifdef</literal> and
<literal>#ifndef</literal>,
are treated as pure comments with no specific meaning.
</para><para>
However, since those were originally borrowed from the C preprocessor,
and true to their C heritage - they started with an '#' (hash) character
in &IC; versions up to and including 4.6.
</para><para>
This was inconvenient for newcomers who were easily misguided by thinking
those were just comments, so Interchange versions 4.7 and up support
meta-directives without the hash prefix.
</para><para>
To preserve compatibility, the default is still <literal>Yes</literal>,
but you should omit the '#' (hash) in new configuration files.

__NAME__ example: Config parser behavior with ConfigParseComments disabled
<programlisting>
ConfigParseComments No

#include comment
# This, and the above line, are pure comments.

# You better prepare the file named 'comment' for the following one:
include comment
</programlisting>
