__NAME__ notes
The actions defined in order profiles can also be used for
<literal>mv_click</literal> actions
if the actions are not defined in &glos-scratch; space. They are accessed by
setting the <mv>mv_order_profile</mv> variable to the name of the order
profile.

OrderProfile etc/profiles.order etc/profiles.login
</programlisting>

__NAME__ example: Dedicated directory for profile definitions
A wildcard can be used instead of listing the files individually. Beware of editor working files, backup files, etc., that would be included with a broad file-matching glob of * even though that would be easiest. It's safer to use something like a uniform .profile suffix as in this example:
<programlisting>
OrderProfile profiles/*.profile
</programlisting>
