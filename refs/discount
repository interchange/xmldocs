__NAME__ description
The tag is used to implement per-customer discounts. Discounts can 
be applied to individual items, groups of items, or total orders.
</para><para>
The tag accepts &PERL; code in its body. Two special variables,
<varname>$q</varname> and <varname>$s</varname>, are available and 
represent item quantity and base price.
</para><para>
&PERL; variables can be shared among &tag-calc; blocks
and the &tag-discount; tag within the same page, allowing for
greater flexibility. See <xref linkend='discount_examples'/>.
</para><para>
For an introduction and theory behind item discounts, please see 
the &glos-discount; glossary entry.

__NAME__ example: Straight 20% discount on all items
<programlisting>
[discount ALL_ITEMS] $s * .8 [/discount]
</programlisting>

Or the same as above, with named attributes:

<programlisting>

__NAME__ example: Discount of 25% for an individual item
To take 25% off of item SKU <literal>00-342</literal>, use:

<programlisting>
[discount 00-342] $s * .75 [/discount]
</programlisting>
__END__

__NAME__ example: Discount of 25% for an individual item, only if quantity ordered is 1
<programlisting>
[discount 00-342] $q == 1 ? $s * 0.75 : $s [/discount]
</programlisting>
__END__


__NAME__ example: A discount of 5 on entire order
<programlisting>
[discount ENTIRE_ORDER] $s - 5 [/discount]
</programlisting>
__END__

__NAME__ example: Resetting discounts
To reset a discount, simply set it to the empty string: 
<programlisting>
[discount ALL_ITEMS /]
</programlisting>
__END__


__NAME__ example: Dynamic discounts using Perl
Perl code can, of course, be used to apply the discounts. Sometimes, 
this needs to include some pre-processing which you need to do outside
the &tag-discount; tag. You can freely do this within the &tag-calc; tag,
as the values will be retained and visible inside &tag-discount;. For 
each item ordered, this example gives a 10% discount for a minimum quantity
of 2, with 5% more for each "extra quantity" (but up to a maximum discount of
30%):

<programlisting>
[calc] 
  [item-list]
    $totalq{"[item-code]"} += [item-quantity];
  [/item-list]
  return '';
[/calc]

[item-list]
  [discount code="[item-code]"]
    return ($s)       if $totalq{"[item-code]"} == 1;
    return ($s * .70) if $totalq{"[item-code]"} > 6;
    return ($s * ( 1 - 0.05 * $totalq{"[item-code]"} ));
  [/discount]
[/item-list]
</programlisting>
__END__


__NAME__ example: Applying discount to a specific "instance" within ordered quantity
Here is an example of a special discount for item code
<literal>00-343</literal> which sets the price of the
<emphasis>second</emphasis> "instance" ordered to <literal>0.01</literal>:

<!-- TODO this the example correct? -->
<programlisting>
[discount 00-343]
  return $s if $q == 1;
  my $p = $s/$q;
  my $t = ($q - 1) * $p;
  $t .= 0.01;
  return $t;
[/discount]
</programlisting>
__END__


__NAME__ example: Displaying the discount amount received
If you want to display the discount amount to the user, simply use the
&tag-item-discount; tag:
<!-- TODO move this to refpage for item-discount -->

<programlisting>
[item-list]
  Discount for [item-code]: [item-discount]
[/item-list]
</programlisting>
__END__


__NAME__ example: Displaying the total discount
When you want to display the total discount for an item, you need to
use &tag-calc;:

<programlisting>
[item-list]
Total discount applied to [item-code] is: [currency][calc]
                                       [item-discount noformat=1] * [item-quantity]
                                     [/calc][/currency]
[/item-list]
</programlisting>
