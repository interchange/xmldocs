__NAME__ description
The &conf-SeparateItems; directive changes the default behavior when ordering
item in quantity greater of 1. Instead of only increasing quantity information,
the items are treated as being separate and are listed just as different 
products would be (one per line).
</para><para>
The directive is of little global use, but it allows item attributes to be
easily set for different instances of the same part number (&glos-SKU;),
such as color or size.
</para><para>
The value can be overridden with both &glos-scratch; and &glos-value;
variable <literal>mv_separate_items</literal>.
