__NAME__ description
The directive specifies whether images can be fetched directly over
the &glos-link-program;.
</para><para>
If the requested file is present and the MimeType for the file's 
extension begins with <literal>image/</literal>, the path will be adjusted
to add &conf-ImageDir; or &conf-ImageDirSecure;, and a
<ulink url="http://www.checkupdown.com/status/E302.html">status 302</ulink>
("Moved temporarily") issued. At that point, the image should
be visible on users' screens.
</para><para>
This whole thing happens before database or session opens, and is quite fast.
<varname>$Vend::tmp_session</varname> is set so no cookie is issued.

__NAME__ notes
This feature was introduced to help cope with the unpleasant behavior
of the Mozilla HTML editor.

__NAME__ example: Enabling DeliverImage
Put the following in &ccf;:
<programlisting>
DeliverImage Yes
</programlisting>
Now to request an image, instead of the usual page (such as
<literal>index.html</literal>), ask &IC; for say,
<literal>interchange.png</literal> (given that the file is present in
&conf-ImageDir; or &conf-ImageDirSecure;, of course).
