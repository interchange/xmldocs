</para><para>
The directive also accepts the following special values:

<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para>
<literal>mv_pc</literal> &mdash; try reading affiliate name from the existing
<mv>mv_pc</mv>
variable, but don't interfere with <mv>mv_pc</mv>'s special values
(value "<literal>RESET</literal>" or values containing only digits).
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
<literal>cookie-<replaceable>NAME</replaceable></literal> &mdash; check the
cookie with label <replaceable>NAME</replaceable>.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
<literal>session</literal> &mdash; stop processing if a &glos-session; for
a visitor already exists.
This setting is useful for sending affiliate traffic to other sites but
preventing them from getting credit for sales made by customers following
their banner back to your site.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
<literal>session-<replaceable>NAME</replaceable></literal> &mdash; stop
processing if 
<replaceable>NAME</replaceable> session variable is set.
</para></listitem>

__NAME__ example: Special treatment for affiliates using variable "specialsource"

</programlisting>
__END__

__NAME__ example: Setting __FILENAME__
Allow affiliates to get credit from redirecting customers back to
your site (there is already a &glos-session;), but only if no other
affiliate is already set:
<programlisting>
__FILENAME__ session-source mv_pc mv_source
</programlisting>
