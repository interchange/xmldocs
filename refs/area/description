The <tag>area</tag> tag expands to a proper hypertext URL &link; which
preserves Interchange session information and arguments passed onto
the targeted page. The target page argument you supply is treated relatively
to the <filename class='directory'>pages/</filename> directory inside your
catalog root directory (CATROOT).

The enclosing &lt;a href=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt; HTML tag is not included. This makes
<tag>area</tag> suitable for use in custom &lt;a&gt; links,
Javascript constructs, <ulink url="http://www.ihip.com/">imagemaps</ulink>
and elsewhere.

The reason this tag was named <literal>area</literal> in the first place
is because it was planned to be used in client side Imagemaps.

The <tag>area</tag> and <tag>page</tag> tags are similar; the following two
constructs are identical:
</para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
[page href="dir/page" arg="mv_arg"]Target Name</a>
<a href="[area href='dir/page' arg='mv_arg']">Target Name</a>
]]></programlisting>
<para>
Besides just producing hypertext links to specific pages, you can also
"embed" complete HTML forms in the target link (for say, one-click ordering
or searches); see <xref linkend="area_examples"/>.
