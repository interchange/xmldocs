__NAME__ description
Besides retrieving file contents from files on the filesystem (as usual),
&IC; has the ability to retrieve file contents from the &glos-database;.
</para><para>
The standard &conf-FileDatabase; setting includes the appropriate
table and column names.
</para><para>
In case the column is unspecified, it defaults
to the current value of global variable <varname>LANG</varname>. In case
the column named after <varname>LANG</varname> value does not exist, &IC;
finally tries with the column <database class='field'>default</database>.

__NAME__ notes
The file database must, as always, be registered first with the 
&conf-Database; directive.
</para><para>
Files in the filesystem, if they exist, always take precedence over file
contents in the database.
</para><para>
As you see, this directive allows you to create catalogs that live in the
database space, without a single file stored on disk. Don't, however,
be fooled by this option &mdash; in general, filesystem is the only
right place for your files.
