__NAME__ description
The directive allows &IC; to save users' authentication info (username/password)
in a &glos-cookie;. Cookie expiration time is set by &conf-SaveExpire; and is
renewed each time they log in.
</para><para>
If the login and password information can be read from a cookie, then 
users can be logged in to the site automatically as they visit it.
__END__


__NAME__ notes
To cause the cookie to be generated originally,
<mv>mv_cookie_password</mv> and/or <mv>mv_cookie_username</mv> must be set
to a &glos-true; value.
The former causes both username and password to be saved; the latter just
the username.

For a complete discussion on cookies, see &glos-cookie; glossary entry.

TODO: Does the above really happen automatically - when you turn on
CookieLogin, or you need ScratchDefault mv_cookie_password 1 or some thing like 
that?
