__NAME__ example: Setting TrackPageParam
<programlisting>
TrackFile logs/trackfile
TrackPageParam  index  var1,var2      index2 var3,var4
</programlisting>
The example will monitor values of the <literal>var1</literal>
and <literal>var2</literal> CGI variables on page
<filename>index.html</filename>, and 
values of the <literal>var3</literal>
and <literal>var4</literal> CGI variables on page
<filename>index2.html</filename>.
</para><para>
To see it in practice, visit the index page of your catalog, append 
<literal><![CDATA[&var1=TEST&var2=500]]></literal> to its URL, and press enter
to visit the page with those CGI variables defined. You'll see 
page accesses recorded in the user tracking file, along with the names
and values of the two variables. The log in the trackfile might look like this:
<programlisting>
20050812  fft2VXwJ  127.0.0.1  1123868228  VIEWPAGE=index  var1=TEST var2=500
</programlisting>
