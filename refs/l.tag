Note:Be careful when editing pages containing localization information. Even changing one character of the message can  change the key value and invalidate the message for other languages. To prevent this, use:

!block example
   [L key]The default.[/L]
	 !endblock


	 The key C<msg_key> will then be used to index the message. This may be preferable for many applications.
