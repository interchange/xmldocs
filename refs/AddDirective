__NAME__ description
The directive allows you to extend the set of regular configuration
directives accepted in each &ccf; with your custom ones, which are then
treated the same as the "built-in" ones.
</para><para>
The 3 standard arguments can be specified, just as you can see in 
<filename>lib/Vend/Config.pm</filename>: the new directive name, name of
the parser/validating function, and a default value.
</para><para>
If the parser function is not defined, then no parser will be called at all,
and the value of the directive will be exactly what users specify in their
&ccf; files (which is usually a &PERL; scalar value). If the parser
argument <emphasis>is</emphasis> supplied, then the parser must already be
defined because it can't be referenced <emphasis>in advance</emphasis>.
</para><para>
<filename>lib/Vend/Config.pm</filename> contains all the default 
parser functions, which are recognized by the mandatory prefix
<literal>parse_</literal>.
</para><para>
Directly modifying <filename>Config.pm</filename> (or any other 
files from the &IC; installation) is discouraged for portability and other
reasons. Therefore, to add your custom parsing function, you should
modify &gcf; as seen in <xref linkend="AddDirective_examples"/>
(note that the parser definition
must logically come before &conf-AddDirective;).
__END__

__NAME__ notes
Note that <literal>boolean</literal>, one of the default parse functions, is
actually
a boolean list, and not a true boolean value. The list achieves the effect
of being boolean by logically returning &glos-true; or &glos-false;,
depending on whether the searched item is present in the list or not.
True boolean values are called <literal>yesno</literal>s in &IC; parlance.

__NAME__ example: Adding a new catalog configuration directive
Let's add the <literal>DocRoot</literal> directive. Put the following 
in your &gcf;:
<programlisting>
AddDirective Foo bar "Hello, World!"
</programlisting>
__END__

__NAME__ missing
Make better example, and exactly show how to define a new parser function without modifying Config.pm directly.
