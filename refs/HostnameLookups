__NAME__ description
The directive specifies whether to perform DNS lookups to resolve
remote users' hostname from their IP address. Hostnames are required
for some facilities, such as &conf-RobotHost; (use &conf-RobotIP; if you
want to keep DNS lookups off).

If the web server is configured to perform hostname lookups itself, then
this directive should remain disabled.
