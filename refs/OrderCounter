__NAME__ description
Specify filename where the simple order number template is kept
(and, of course, incremented with every new order). Within the template,
the right-most number is found and incremented, preserving zero
padding, if any.

If the counter file is unset, then the order number will be
assigned a string in form of
<literal><replaceable>session_id</replaceable>.<replaceable>unix_time</replaceable></literal>.

__NAME__ notes
Bear in mind that &IC; provides this order number counter only as a convenience
for display, and that no internal functions depend on it. Custom order number
routines may be defined and used without fear of consequences.
