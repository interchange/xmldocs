__NAME__ synopsis
<arg choice='plain'><replaceable>filename</replaceable></arg>
__END__


__NAME__ description
Specify the &IC; debug output file. If the filename is not absolute,
it is treated relative to the Interchange root directory (&glos-ICROOT;).
</para><para>
When enabled, the debug file will gather output of the
<function>::logDebug()</function> Interchange statements and &PERL; warnings
(if they are enabled).
__END__

__NAME__ see also
DEBUG, DataTrace
__END__

__NAME__ notes
Keep in mind that
you need to have the <varname>DEBUG</varname> global variable
defined.
</para><para>
Also, as the <function>::logDebug()</function> statements are disabled
(commented) 
by default in Interchange sources, you'll probably want to use a special
script for managing debug statements, or manually uncomment parts of 
debugging code in question (and restart Interchange, of course &mdash;
see <olink targetdoc='howtos' targetptr='daemon-control'/>).
