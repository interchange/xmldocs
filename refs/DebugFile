__NAME__ description
Specify the Interchange debug output file. If the filename is not absolute,
it is treated relative to the Interchange root directory (ICROOT).
</para><para>
When enabled, the debug file will gather output of the
<function>::logDebug()</function> Interchange statements and Perl warnings
(if they are enabled).
__END__

__NAME__ see also
DEBUG, DataTrace
__END__

__NAME__ notes
Keep in mind that
you need to have the <varname>DEBUG</varname> global variable
defined.
</para><para>
Also, as the <function>::logDebug()</function> statements are disabled
(commented) 
by default in Interchange sources, you'll probably want to use a special
script for managing debug statements, or manually uncomment parts of 
debugging code in question (and restart Interchange, of course &mdash;
see &howto-daemon-control;).

__NAME__ example: Setting DebugFile
<programlisting>
Variable DEBUG 1
DebugFile /tmp/icdebug
</programlisting>
