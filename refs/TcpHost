__NAME__ description
The &conf-TcpHost; directive defines a list of hostnames whose 
connections to the &IC; Inet socket will be accepted.
This effectively allows or denies access to all catalogs running on the
corresponding &IC; server.

It's important to note that the directive <emphasis role='bold'>does not
</emphasis> support wildcards or anything, it only accepts plain list
of space-separated IPs or hostnames.

<!--
accepts a wildcard list -
<literal>*</literal> represents any number of characters, while
<literal>?</literal> represents a single character.
-->

TODO: Why not as RobotHost etc, accepting wildcards and proper comma-
  separated list ?
