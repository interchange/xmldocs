This pragma strips whitespace from the top of HTML pages output by Interchange.
Such whitespace usually comes from Interchange tags which get processed and
leave empty space behind them. The purpose of this pragma is to make
<emphasis>View source</emphasis> option in your web browser a slightly more tolerable experience.
