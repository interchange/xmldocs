This pragma strips whitespace from the top of &glos-HTML; pages output by &IC.
Such whitespace usually comes from Interchange tags which get processed and
leave empty space behind them. The purpose of this pragma is to make
<emphasis>View source</emphasis> option in your web browser a more
tolerable experience.
