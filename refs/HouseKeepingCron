__NAME__ description
  The targets are GlobalSub or anything which you can make run
  with Vend::Dispatch::run_macro. Bear in mind there is no
  catalog context.
</para>
<para>
  Two special targets exist, <literal>:reconfig</literal> and <literal>:jobs</literal>. 
  They allow calling
  of the catalog reconfig routines and jobs routines, respectively.
  The etc/reconfig and etc/jobsqueue files will be ignored if these
  targets are not present -- a warning will be issued at startup
  (and crontab change) if they are not there.
</para>
<para>
  A target prepended with > runs *after* the reconfig/restart/jobs/pid
  mgmt cycle. Normal specifications run before.
