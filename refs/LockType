__NAME__ description
The directive specifies the file locking method to use. 
<literal>flock</literal> is the default and works well with standard
setups.
</para><para>
<literal>fcntl</literal> is used with &NFS;. In case of NFS, both
the NFS client and server need to run the lock daemon
(<command>lockd</command>).
</para><para>
<literal>none</literal> can be used to turn off locking completely. This
is never recommended, unless you only want to see if the locking 
is causing system hangs.
__END__

__NAME__ notes
Although this directive was added in &IC; 4.7, due to an error later
discovered, the directive started working properly with the release
of &IC; 4.8.6.
</para><para>
If you are only accessing sessions on an NFS-mounted directory, but the rest
of Interchange is on the local filesystem, you can set the &conf-SessionType;
directive to <literal>NFS</literal> instead. That would enable
<literal>fcntl</literal> locking for sessions on a per-catalog basis only.
