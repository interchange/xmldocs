__NAME__ description

Sets the routine which is run when a page is not found. Passed the name of
the page, returns two parameters.


</para>

<para>
<screen>
    ($handled, $newpage) = $sub-&gt;($name)
</screen>


</para>

<para>
If <literal>$handled</literal> is true, Interchange does not follow its normal missing page procedure of
displaying the special page <literal>missing</literal>. It will display the page <literal>$newpage</literal> if present,
otherwise will simply return without sending any response -- it assumes
your routine handled any response phase.

<para>
The name of a subroutine which will provide a credit card type given the
number. Interchange normally recognizes some major ones like Visa,
Mastercard, etc., but if you are in a country with local credit cards you
may need more.


</para>

<para>
Here is an example as placed in catalog.cfg:


</para>

<para>
<screen>
        ## Map a subroutine to guess custom credit card types
        SpecialSub  guess_cc_type  special_cc
</screen>


</para>

<para>
<screen>
        Sub special_cc &lt;&lt;EOS
        sub {
                my $num = shift;
                return 'foobar' if $num =~ /^41/;
                return undef;
        }
        EOS
</screen>


</para>

<para>
The call in Vend::Order is:


</para>

<para>
<screen>
        $guess = $sub-&gt;($ccnum)
</screen>


</para>

<para>
If your routine returns a non-false value, that is returned as the credit
card type. If your routine returns false, it allows Interchange to guess.
