__NAME__ description
The &conf-WideOpen; directive disables IP-based qualification of user
&glos-session;s.
This increases compatibility, but reduces &glos-catalog; security.
</para><para>
When this directive is enabled, no IP-based checking is done, so 
anyone guessing and supplying a valid session ID can hijack other client's
session.
</para><para>
The option was introduced to achieve more compatibility with old browsers, at
cost of some security. Do not enable it unless your clients experience
problems caused by IP addresses that change from access to access.
Also do not use it unless you are using encryption
(PGP/&conf-CreditCardAuto;) or a real-time payment gateway, or the risk may
be too high.
