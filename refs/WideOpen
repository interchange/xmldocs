__NAME__ description
The &conf-WideOpen; directive disables IP-based qualification user sessions,
which usually results in reduced catalog security.
</para><para>
When &conf-WideOpen; is enabled, no IP-based checking is done, so 
anyone guessing and supplying a valid session ID can hijack other client's
session.
</para><para>
The option was introduced to achieve more compatibility with old browsers, at
cost of some security. Do not enable it unless you first experience problems.
Also do not use it unless you are using some encryption
(PGP/&conf-CreditCardAuto;) or a real-time payment gateway, such as
&glos-CyberCash;.
