__NAME__ description
When &conf-__FILENAME__; is enabled, &glos-GET; requests from RobotUAs
to URLs with <mv>mv_session_id</mv> provided are redirected to the
same URL minus the session_id
</para><para>
This keeps search engines that respect redirects from storing the
session_id-salted URLs in their indexes, and helps them focus on the
real resource with a single URL instead of a multitude of salted
links.
