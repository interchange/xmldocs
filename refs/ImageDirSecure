__NAME__ description
The directive specifies a base location, accessible over the web,
where &IC; should look for IMG and INPUT &glos-HTML;
<literal>src=</literal> file specifications,
<emphasis role='bold'>when the originating page is being served
over a secure connection (HTTPS)</emphasis>.
To be precise, actually, this setting applies to image locations mentioned in <![CDATA[ <img src="">, <input src="">, <body background="">, <table background=""> and table subelements (<th>, <tr> and <td>).]]>
</para><para>
This is useful if you are using separate HTTPS and HTTP servers, and cannot
make the image directory path heads match. If &conf-ImageDirSecure; is
unspecified, it defaults to &conf-ImageDir;.
__END__

__NAME_ notes
<emphasis role='bold'>In most setups, you want to include the 
trailing "<literal>/</literal>" at the end to achieve the intended behavior.
</emphasis>
</para><para>
As with all directives, &conf-ImageDirSecure; can be made locale-dependent to
elegantly allow for multilingual setups.
</para><para>
If you count on &conf-ImageDirSecure; being unspecified and falling back
to &conf-ImageDir;, then you don't want to have your &conf-ImageDir; 
location starting with "<literal>http://</literal>".
