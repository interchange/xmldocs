__NAME__ description
The directive allows definition of realtime blocklist servers (special-purpose
DNS servers) that should be contacted in order to verify client IP address
"validity". This way, you can deny access to known-bad clients (such
as ones coming in from open proxy servers).
</para><para>
Many fraudulent credit card orders are placed from open proxy machines
to hide the actual identity of the criminal, so denying access to 
open-proxy visitors might be a good idea.
