__NAME__ description
Trace DBI calls with variable granularity.
As this tends to produce large ammounts of output, only use it if
there's a strong chance that your problem is related to DBI.
</para><para>
Setting of <literal>0</literal> disables tracing.<sbr/>
Setting of <literal>1</literal> traces DBI method calls with return values (or errors)<sbr/>
Setting of <literal>2</literal> traces as (1) plus the parameters used in method calls<sbr/>
Setting of <literal>3</literal> traces as (2) plus some high-level information from the driver, and some internal information from the DBI<sbr/>
Setting of <literal>4</literal> traces as (3) plus more detailed information from the driver. Also includes DBI mutex information when using threaded Perl<sbr/>
Setting of <literal>5</literal> traces as (4) plus more and more obscure information<sbr/>
</para><para>
Trace level of <literal>1</literal> is suitable in most situations.

__NAME__ notes
Keep in mind that, since the trace output is directed to the debug file,
you need to have the <varname>DEBUG</varname> global variable
defined, and <option>DebugFile</option> properly set.
