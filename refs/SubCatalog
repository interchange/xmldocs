__NAME__ description
The directive allows definition of "subcatalogs" &mdash; &glos-catalog;s that
share most of the characteristics of
another, "base" catalog.
In a &conf-SubCatalog; setup, the appropriate &ccf; should only contain
directives that differ from definitions in the base catalog's &ccf;.
</para><para>
&IC;'s subcatalogs feature isn't used much, but primary reasons for its use
would be memory savings, or some kind of chained-configuration catalogs.
</para><para>
Concerning the directive arguments, <literal>subcatalog_name</literal> and
<literal>base_catalog_name</literal> are the names of the new and existing
catalog respectively. <literal>catalog_directory</literal> (&glos-CATROOT;)
defines the catalog root directory, and can be the same for both the master-
and sub-catalog. Finally, the &glos-link-program; is a webserver path by
which the subcatalog can be accessed.
