__NAME__ notes
<!-- if you change this, also change the same in refs/perl -->
The &tag-calc; tag is lower-overhead variant of &tag-perl;, because it
does not accept arguments, does not try to interpolate tag body, does not
pre-open any database tables, and it doesn't do any extra wrapping.
</para><para>
The &tag-calc; tag will remember variable values inside the page, so you
can do the equivalent of a memory store and memory recall for a loop. In 
other words, variables you initialize or set in one &tag-calc; block are
also visible in all further &tag-calc; blocks on the same page.

There is no reason to ever use this tag inside &tag-perl; or &tag-mvasp;.
