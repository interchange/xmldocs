</para><para>
Prepend a starting <literal>0</literal> to indicate an octal value. The
directive can be overridden from the command line using <literal>interchange
-r SocketPerms=<replaceable>value</replaceable></literal>.
</para><para>
The default value is <literal>0600</literal>, which allows only programs
running under your &IC; server UID to access the socket.
</para><para>
Another possible setting is <literal>0666</literal> if other programs needs
to access the socket file, e.g. Apache2 via mod_perl and Interchange::Link.
Please note that this setting is insecure, it allows every user on the system
to communicate through the socket.

__NAME__ notes
Although not recommended in practice, it sometimes makes sense to
set the permissions to <literal>0666</literal> (world-writable) to 
debug problems easier.
