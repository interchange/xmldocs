__NAME__ description
Specify permissions (&glos-mode;) for the Interchange UNIX-domain socket file.
</para><para>
Prepend a starting <literal>0</literal> to indicate an octal value. The
directive can be overridden from the command line using <literal>interchange
-r SocketPerms=<replaceable>value</replaceable></literal>.
</para><para>
The default value is <literal>0600</literal>, which allows only programs
running under your &IC; server UID to access the socket.
</para><para>
Another possible value is <literal>0666</literal>. This is a bit
insecure setting, as it allows anyone on the system to access the socket.
It may come handy, however, if programs such as &APACHE; need to access
the socket via &MOD_PERL; or our <classname>Interchange::Link</classname>
module.

__NAME__ notes
You might want to try the discussed mode, <literal>0666</literal>,
when your &IC; installation isn't working and you quickly want to find out
whether it's just socket file permissions problem or something deeper.
