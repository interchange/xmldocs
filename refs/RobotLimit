__NAME__ description
Specify maximum number of 
consecutive pages a user may access without a short pause.
</para><para>
When the &conf-RobotLimit; is 
exceeded, the command defined in &conf-LockoutCommand; will be executed and
the catalog URLs will be rewritten to 
<literal>127.0.0.1</literal>, effectively pointing the robot back to itself.
</para><para>
The short pause amounts to 30 seconds and can be configured using the &conf-Limit;
directive's <literal>lockout_reset_seconds</literal> setting.
</para><para>
If a remote client gets assigned a new session with every visit, rather than
maintaining a single session, then this directive sets the limit for the
number of sessions that may be assigned to the individual IP address over a
one hour period.  The one hour period can be overridden using the &conf-Limit;
directive's <literal>ip_session_expire</literal> setting. If a lockout is triggered it will
remain in effect for 1 day.  The one day period can be overridden with the
&conf-Limit; directive's <literal>robot_expire</literal> setting.

__NAME__ notes
Set the directive to a number greater than the number of pages users are
ever expected to visit in a short time frame.
