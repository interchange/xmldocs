__NAME__ description
The &conf-SessionDatabase; directive defines the location
of the user &glos-session;s database, and the path may be absolute.
</para><para>
For DBM sessions, an appropriate <literal>.db</literal> or 
<literal>.gdbm</literal> suffix will be appended. For the default
file-based sessions, the directive specifies the name of a base
sessions directory.

It is possible for multiple catalogs to share the same session file, as
well as for multiple &IC; servers to serve the same catalogs. If serving an
extremely busy store, multiple parallel Interchange servers can share the
same (NFS-based) file system, and serve users in a "ping-pong" fashion using
file-based sessions. On huge systems, even the level of directory hashing 
may be changed to increase file look-up speeds. By default,
only 48 * 48 hashing is done.
