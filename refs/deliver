__NAME__ description
The main function of this pragma is to prevent any interpolation of the output.
It helps to preserve the downloads intact if they 
happen to contain constructs similar to
<literal>__<replaceable>VAR</replaceable>__</literal> 
or <literal>[tag]</literal>.
</para><para>
In practice, this pragma is only used internally. If
you wanted to make Interchange a content-delivery engine only, you could
set it in <filename>catalog.cfg</filename>, and only undefine it for a few
pages where you want standard page processing.
</para><para>
You might take a look at the <tag>deliver</tag> tag which uses this
pragma.
