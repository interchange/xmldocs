* Add RedirectCache directive which allows redirected page requests to
  be set to mv_tmp_session then written to the target from which it was
  redirected. This allows a complete web site to be mirrored to static
  HTML as it is requested, accompanied with the proper setting of
  AcceptRedirect in Interchange and ErrorDocument in the Apache server.

  To use: 
  
       * Set ErrorDocument 404 to the Interchange URL in Apache.

     * Set "AcceptRedirect Yes" in interchange.cfg.
  
     * Set "RedirectCache /var/www/html" in interchange.cfg (use
       your document root in place of /var/www/html).

  When a page http://yourdomain.tld/subdir/page.html is not found,
  Interchange gets a redirect which causes it to set mv_tmp_session=1.
  If Interchange doesn't find the page, then it returns "missing" and
  no writing is done. If IC does find the page, it is written to
  /var/www/html/subdir/page.html and the page will be found on next
  access.


session is not initialized with redirectcache
