__NAME__ description
This directive, along with &conf-AcceptRedirect;, allows
the web server to route requests for missing static HTML pages to &IC;.
Interchange processes the requests and saves the produced static content
to the directory pointed by &conf-__FILENAME__;. On next web server
page access, the pages are found and served as static content by the
web server directly.
</para><para>
Requests routed to &IC; in this way use a temporary session (<mv>mv_tmp_session</mv>).
In case the &IC; page is not found, the usual &conf-SpecialPage; "missing"
is shown and no writing to the web server HTML directory takes place.
