__NAME__ description
If the directive is enabled, &IC; produces more XHTML-compliant &glos-HTML;
output. This just includes the insertion of "<literal>/</literal>" 
in standalone tag endings, since argument name lowercasing and argument
option quoting (the other two "things" that make XHTML XHTML)
have been already adopted practices for all HTML output.
__END__

__NAME__ notes
&IC; is gradually adopting XHTML-compliant &glos-HTML; code. Therefore,
some things might still not be XHTML-ready even after users enable
&conf-XHTML;.
</para><para>
Making HTML output XHTML-compliant is extremely easy (basically, you only
need to lowercase argument names, quote argument options, and include 
<varname>$Vend::Xtrailer</varname> before the ending
"<literal>&gt;</literal>" for standalone tags. That said, XHTML-compliance
patches are gladly accepted to speed up the transition process.
