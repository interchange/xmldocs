__NAME__ description
The directive allows routing error messages to different files, based on 
either message content or an arbitrary tag.

This allows us to add message "routing" information at a single place
in the catalog configuration, instead of having to provide 
<arg choice='plain'>file</arg> attribute to each invocation of 
error-related tags of functions.
