__NAME__ description
The directive specifies catalogs and the corresponding usernames
which will be used in accessing files with absolute pathnames.
Actually, the file access itself is still performed under the &IC;
server username, but the &conf-CatalogUser; values are used for
a "would-be" kind of check.
</para><para>
This directive is only honored when &conf-NoAbsolute; is enabled.
Then, the situation is as follows:
<itemizedlist>
	<listitem><para>
		&IC; allows the file to be read or written if the absolute pathname 
		points somewhere in the catalog directory (&glos-CATROOT;) or
		&conf-TemplateDir;.
	</para></listitem>
	<listitem><para>
		&IC; allows the file to be read if the appropriate catalog's
		&conf-CatalogUser; is file owner, or belongs to a user group that
		can read the file. (The same analogy is used for write access).
	</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
