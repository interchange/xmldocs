__NAME__ description
The directive specifies the global &glos-locale; for error messages.
The content is usually loaded from a file.

If two locales are set "default" using &conf-Locale;, and no
&conf-DefaultLocale; is specified, the behavior is undefined as the first
"default" found will be set as the actual default.

Put the following in &gcf;:

LI1: price_picture

.Interchange will format a currency number based on a "picture" given to it. The basic form is:

!block example; listitem=2
    Locale en_US price_picture "$ ###,###,###.##"
!endblock

.The C<en_US> locale, for the United States, would display C<4452.3> as C<$ 4,452.30>. The same display can be achieved with:

!block example; listitem=2
     Locale en_US mon_thousands_sep ,
     Locale en_US mon_decimal_point .
     Locale en_US p_cs_precedes     1
     Locale en_US currency_symbol   $
!endblock

.A common price_picture for European countries would be C<###.###.###,##>, which would display that same number as C<4.452,30>. To add a franc notation at the end for the locale C<fr_FR>, use the setting:

!block example; listitem=2
    Locale fr_FR price_picture "##.###,## fr"
!endblock

Note[label='IMPORTANT NOTE: '] The decimal point in use, set by C<mon_decimal_point>, and the thousands separator, set by C<mon_thousands_sep> must match the settings in the price_picture. The C<frac_digits> setting is not used in this case. It is derived from the location of the decimal (if any).

.The same setting for C<fr_FR> above can be achieved with:

!block example; listitem=2
     Locale fr_FR mon_thousands_sep .
     Locale fr_FR mon_decimal_point ,
     Locale fr_FR p_cs_precedes     0
     Locale fr_FR currency_symbol   fr
!endblock

.If the number of digits is greater than the # locations in the price_picture, the digits will be changed to asterisks. An overflow number above would show as C<**.***,** fr>.

LI1: picture

.Same as C<price_picture>, but sets the value returned if the C<[currency]> tag is not used. If the number of digits is greater than the # locations in the picture, the digits will be changed to asterisks, displaying something like C<**,***.**>.






H2: Placing Locale Information in a Database

Interchange has the capability to read its locale information from a database, named with the C<LocaleDatabase> directive. The database can be of any valid Interchange type. The locales are in columns, and the keys are in rows. For example, to set up price information:

!block example
   key                 en_US   fr_FR   de_DE
   PriceDivide         1       .1590   .58
   mon_decimal_point   .       ,       ,
   mon_thousands_sep   ,       .
   currency_symbol     $        frs    DM
   ps_cs_precedes      1       0       0
!endblock

This would translate to the following:

!block example
   Locale en_US PriceDivide         1
   Locale en_US mon_decimal_point   .
   Locale en_US mon_thousands_sep   ,
   Locale en_US currency_symbol     $
   Locale en_US ps_cs_precedes      1

   Locale fr_FR PriceDivide         .1590
   Locale fr_FR mon_decimal_point   ,
   Locale fr_FR mon_thousands_sep   .
   Locale fr_FR currency_symbol     " frs"
   Locale fr_FR ps_cs_precedes      0

   Locale de_DE PriceDivide         .58
   Locale de_DE mon_decimal_point   ,
   Locale de_DE mon_thousands_sep   " "
   Locale de_DE currency_symbol     "DM "
   Locale de_DE ps_cs_precedes      1
!endblock

These settings append and overwrite any that are set in the catalog configuration files, including any include files. 

Important note: This information is only read during catalog configuration. It is not reasonable to access a database for translation or currency conversion in the normal course of events.
