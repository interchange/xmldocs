Intercept all outgoing email and instead send it to the address
(or addresses, comma-separated) defined in this global or catalog
variable. This is primarily intended to allow developers to write
functions that send email and test them without worrying about
accidentally sending mail to end-users.

Headers in the form <literal>X-Intercepted-To:</literal> etc. are added to
show what the original destination of the mail was, and the interception
is also noted in the catalog error log.
