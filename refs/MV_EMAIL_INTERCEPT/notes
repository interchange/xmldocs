Note that this only works for &IC;'s built-in e-mail sending
routines. If you use other methods to send e-mail, for example by directly
running <command>sendmail</command> or talking to an &glos-SMTP; server
you'll have to add implement support yourself.

Be aware that this setting can mask certain programming errors. For
example, trying to send an e-mail without a
<literal>To:</literal> address would normally result
in an error. With email interception, however, a valid
<literal>To:</literal> address would be used, and seemingly work as
expected. Before switching off the interception, the only
way to know whether you did everything right is to check the
<literal>X-Intercepted-To:</literal>
header and verify its correctness. Probably even easier, you should
just monitor error log files as the original e-mail destination is
reported there as well.
