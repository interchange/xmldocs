Note that this only works for Interchange's built-in routines for sending
email. If you use other methods to send mail, for example by directly
running sendmail or talking to an SMTP server, you'll have to add
interception support yourself.

Be aware that this setting can mask certain programming errors. For
example, trying to send an email without a To address normally results
in an error. But with email interception, a valid To address is actually
used, so no error results. Before switching off interception, the only
way to know you have a problem is by checking the X-Intercepted-To:
header and noticing it's empty, or by looking at the catalog error log
and seeing that an empty To: header was intercepted.
