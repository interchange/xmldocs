__NAME__ description
Many &glos-HTML; editing applications do not support &glos-ITL; directly, and
some 
(thinking it doesn't belong to the page) ruin your work. This is 
understandable to an extent, because some ITL tags (such as <tag>list</tag>)
appear in places that raise errors with HTML syntax checking algorithms.
</para><para>
So in order to help that, Interchange allows you to <emphasis>wrap</emphasis>
ITL code into HTML comments, which the editing applications leave alone in
most cases.
</para><para>
When such HTML comment is found, it is stripped away, ITL tags are interpolated
and the output is displayed as if HTML comment was never there.
</para><para>
To make use of this <emphasis>arcane</emphasis> feature, simply leave no
space between the HTML comment and ITL tags:
</para>
<programlisting>
<![CDATA[
The time is now <!--[time]-->.
]]>
</programlisting>
<para>
Setting the <pragma>no_html_comment_embed</pragma> &glos-pragma; instructs
Interchange
<emphasis role='bold'>not</emphasis> to parse and interpolate any HTML
comments. With this pragma enabled, the above example would not display
the current time.
__END__


__NAME__ example: Enable no_html_comment_embed pragma page-wide
Put the following anywhere on your page:
<programlisting>
[pragma no_html_comment_embed]
</programlisting>
__END__


__NAME__ notes
Although this feature existed in Interchange for a very long time, the
pragma to control its behavior was added in September 2004, after someone
stumbled on it by accident and wanted to remove it.
