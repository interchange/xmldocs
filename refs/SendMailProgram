__NAME__ description
The directive specifies the location of the <command>sendmail</command>
binary (executable file).
__END__

__NAME__ notes
It is not required to specifically use the original
<command>sendmail</command> with this directive. Probably all available
<command>sendmail</command> replacements include the
<command>sendmail</command> binary of their own, but which is completely
compatible with the original implementation (regarding command line 
options).
</para><para>
If this directive is not defined (and none of the defaults are available at
startup), it won't be possible to send any e-mails using standard &IC;
facilities.
