__NAME__ description
Specify the default page to show in a directory.
</para><para>
When the location requested does not exist, and this directive is set, 
&IC; will try to append the specified filename to the URL, and re-test
for the page existence.
</para><para>
This directive sets the default page for all directories
<emphasis role='bold'>except</emphasis> the catalog entry point.
(In other words, this directive won't help you make 
<literal>http://&def-hostname;/</literal> show
<literal>http://&def-hostname;/index.html</literal> -
see the &conf-SpecialPage; for that).
__END__

__NAME__ notes
Although the name for this directive was borrowed from the &APACHE; Web
Server project, it only accepts one filename (unlike Apache which supports
multiple filenames to look for in sequential order).
