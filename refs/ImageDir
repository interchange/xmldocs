__NAME__ example: Setting PageDir depending on current locale
To use a different page directory for different locales, say French and
English, help yourself with the robust &conf-Locale; directive:
<programlisting>
# Establish the default at startup
PageDir   english

# Establish locale-dependent directories
Locale fr_FR  PageDir  francais
Locale en_US  PageDir  english
</programlisting>
To fully understand the example and implicitly presented &IC; features, make
sure you're familiar with &glos-internationalization; and &glos-locale;
glossary
entries.

.To use a different image directory for different locales, set the C<ImageDir> key. To have two separate language button sets, French and English, set:

!block example; listitem=2
# Establish the default at startup
ImageDir   /images/english/
Locale fr_FR  ImageDir   /images/francais/
Locale en_US  ImageDir   /images/english/
!endblock
