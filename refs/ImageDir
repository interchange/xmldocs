__NAME__ description
&conf-ImageDir; is one of quite basic settings in every &ccf;.
</para><para>
The directive specifies a base location, accessible over the web,
where &IC; should look for IMG and INPUT &glos-HTML;
<literal>src=</literal> file specifications.
To be precise, actually, this setting applies to image locations mentioned
in <![CDATA[
<img src="">, <input src="">, <body background="">, <table background=""> and table subelements (<th>, <tr> and <td>).]]>
</para><para>
As you might know, &IC; keeps its pages in a special directory
<filename class='directory'>pages/</filename> (which is a subdirectory of 
your catalog's &glos-CATROOT;). That directory can be readable only by the 
&IC; user, and contents in it cannot be accessed by the web server without
&IC; mediating the connection. This directory is generally supposed to 
only contain directories and Interchange-enabled &glos-HTML; pages,
and nothing else.
</para><para>
It is therefore obvious that an alternative way has to be provided
to serve images. When you define &conf-ImageDir;, &IC; will appropriately
and transparently prefix all &lt;img src=...&gt; &glos-HTML; tags with
your value.
</para><para>
For example, if the &glos-link-program; and images are kept on the same
server, and images are found in your web server's document root,
in the <filename class='directory'>images/</filename> subdirectory, then
you would set &conf-ImageDir; to <literal>/images/</literal>.
With this setting in effect, a link such as &lt;img src="order.png"&gt;
would be changed to &lt;img src="/images/order.png"&gt;.

__NAME_ notes
<emphasis role='bold'>In most setups, you want to include the 
trailing "<literal>/</literal>" at the end to achieve the intended behavior.

As with all directives, &conf-ImageDir; can be made locale-dependent to
elegantly allow for multilingual setups.
