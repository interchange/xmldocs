__NAME__ description
&conf-ImageDir; is one of quite basic settings in every &ccf;.
</para><para>
The directive specifies a base location, accessible over the web,
where &IC; should look for image files, when just relative image
filename is given.
Automatically "translated" are image locations mentioned
in <![CDATA[
<img src="">, <input src="">, <body background="">, <table background=""> and table subelements (<th>, <tr> and <td>).]]>
</para><para>
A setting of &conf-ImageDir; <literal>/images/</literal> and a specification
of <literal>&lt;img src="test/test.png"&gt;</literal> would be
translated to <literal>&lt;img src="/images/test/test.png"&gt;</literal>.

__NAME_ notes
<emphasis role='bold'>In most setups, you want to include the 
trailing "<literal>/</literal>" at the end to achieve the intended behavior.
</emphasis>
</para><para>
As with all directives, &conf-ImageDir; can be made locale-dependent to
elegantly allow for multilingual setups.
