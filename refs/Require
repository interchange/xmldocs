__NAME__ description
Just like &conf-Capability; or &conf-Suggest;, this directive checks for
a feature or capability. When the tested feature is missing, a 
catalog is <emphasis role='bold'>not</emphasis> configured and included
in global configuration.

This is useful to ensure that needed facilities are present, especially if 
you run the catalog on different locations.

"Capabilities" you can check for are
<literal>globalsub</literal>,
<literal>sub</literal>,  
<literal>taggroup</literal>,
<literal>usertag</literal> and
<literal>module</literal>.
