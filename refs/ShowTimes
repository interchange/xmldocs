__NAME__ description
The &conf-ShowTimes; directive makes &IC; include timing statistics
in debug output.
__END__

__NAME__ notes
Calls to the <function>show_times()</function> function are commented out
in most of the &IC; source. To enable &conf-ShowTimes;, you also need to 
search for occurrences of <literal>ShowTimes</literal> in the actual source,
and un-comment the appropriate lines, then restart &IC; of course. You can
effectively search the source by executing
<command>grep -r ShowTimes *</command> within &glos-ICROOT;.
Lines you're interested for will look like this:
<screen>
lib/Vend/Server.pm:#show_times("begin response send") if $Global::ShowTimes;
</screen>
and you will need to remove the "#".
