__NAME__ description
The directive
enables processing of HTTP server redirects, i.e. when handling ErrorDocument
for a Web server such as &APACHE;. For instance, if your
<filename>httpd.conf</filename> contains

<programlisting>
  ErrorDocument 404 /cgi-bin/ic/&std-catalog;
</programlisting>

then a request for <literal>/somedir/index.html</literal> that is not found
on the Web server would be resent to
<filename>/cgi-bin/ic/foundation/somedir/index.html</filename>, and
would be 
indistinguishable from the Web server-served page by the client.
__END__


__NAME__ notes
Although the idea seems attractive at first sight,
caution should be taken not to allow Web server's ErrorDocument redirection
to &IC; globally &mdash; it would render you subject to a
denial-of-service attack at random URLs (i.e. a flood of MS Windows
"Code Red" attacks). It is recommended that you enable it only for
specific directories, as &APACHE; or another HTTP server will stand up
much better under such a flood.
