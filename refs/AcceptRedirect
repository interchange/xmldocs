__NAME__ description
The directive
enables processing of HTTP server redirects, i.e. when handling ErrorDocument
for a Web server such as &APACHE;. For instance, if your Apache
<filename>httpd.conf</filename> contains

<programlisting>
  ErrorDocument 404 /cgi-bin/ic/&std-catalog;
</programlisting>

then a request for <literal>/somedir/index.html</literal> that is not found
on the Web server would be resent to
<literal>/cgi-bin/ic/foundation/somedir/index.html</literal>, and
would be indistinguishable from the static Web server-served page.
__END__


__NAME__ notes
Combined with the &conf-RedirectCache; directive, you can automatically
create missing &glos-HTML; pages in your web server's static HTML space,
so that they <emphasis role='bold'>are</emphasis> found on next access.
Just beware; that turns them into static pages!
</para><para>
Although the idea seems attractive at first sight,
caution should be taken not to allow Web server's ErrorDocument redirection
to &IC; globally &mdash; it would render you subject to a
denial-of-service attack at random URLs (i.e. a flood of MS Windows
"Code Red" attacks). It is recommended that you enable it only for
specific directories, as &APACHE; or another HTTP server would stand
much better up to such a "limited-scale" flood.
