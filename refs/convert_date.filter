__NAME__ notes
Although this filter looks almost exactly like the &tag-convert-date; tag, 
there's one simple difference in the implementation which is interesting
to mention. If you call the &tag-convert-date; tag with empty 
(or invalid) time string, it will default to the current
time; if you call this &filter-convert_date; filter with an empty time string,
then the current time will <emphasis role='bold'>not</emphasis> be assumed
(because &filter-convert_date; won't call &tag-convert-date; with no data)
and empty string will stay an empty string.
