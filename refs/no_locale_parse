__NAME__ description
This &glos-pragma; disables parsing of <tag>L</tag> and <tag>LC</tag> tags.
</para><para>
This is only used in the Admin UI and is not of interest to the general public.
It could also have some side effects in PreFork &glos-ic-run-mode;
If you have enough traffic that you want to run in PreFork mode, you will
be wanting to move the Admin UI away from the customer-facing side anyway,
so this will not be a problem.
