__NAME__ description
&IC; page servers are, by default, periodically restarted to make sure
there are no problems arising from long-running processes
(such as memory leaks).
</para><para>
In general, restarting is handled by the
&conf-MaxRequestsPerChild; configuration directive.
</para><para>
However, when &conf-PreFork; &glos-ic-run-mode; is used, some page servers
never win the page server "selection battle"; they never get to serve a page
request and consequently they are never restarted by &conf-MaxRequestsPerChild;.
This is why the &conf-ChildLife; directive restarts
a page server on an unconditional, periodic basis to make sure all servers
are re-started from time to time.
</para><para>
If &conf-ChildLife; is not set, the "starved" page servers will act just
like they did before; get stuck in an internal loop forever until
<command>kill -9</command> on the process happens.
</para><para>
This should clear up the problem where people see with a growing number of
servers over time.
