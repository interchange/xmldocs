__NAME__ description
This directive combiles with SessionHashLevels to configure the number of levels and hash length for
the directory structure of file-based sessions.

Default is 1.

This solves the problem of session IDs passed from CGI::Session or other
modules that use a quasi-sequential session ID. You end up placing all
sessions in the S/2 directory for a long time, followed by the S/3 directory,
etc. A setting of:

SessionHashLength   4
SessionHashLevels   1

would break sessions up into separate directories instead of putting all
sessions in a huge directory.

__NAME__ notes
The default value of 1, combined with SessionHashLevels of 2, creates a 
directory structure like:

<programlisting>
	4
	 +----w
	6
	 +----r
	D
	 +----9
	 +----R
	r
	 +----z
	s
	 +----s
	X
	 +----s
	z
	 +----3
</programlisting>

__NAME__ example: Setting SessionExpire
Put the following in &ccf;:
<programlisting>
SessionHashLength  4
SessionHashLevels  1
</programlisting>
