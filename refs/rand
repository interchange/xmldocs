__NAME__ description
This tag read the list of elements, separated by
<arg choice='plain'>separator</arg>, and returns one random element.
</para><para>
The list of elements can be either passed in from the 
<arg choice='plain'>file</arg> argument or it can be specified in-place,
in the tag body.
</para><para>
If the <arg choice='plain'>file</arg> argument is specified, it takes
precedence over the tag body content. Note that using large files
can impact performance, since they are read in to memory before a random
element is selected.

__NAME__ notes
During the split operation (performed on the list to extract single elements),
the whitespace <emphasis role='bold'>is</emphasis> significant, so make sure
you do not have excessive spaces around elements. If you do, and especially
if the separator used is a space character itself, you will sometimes get
empty elements in return.
