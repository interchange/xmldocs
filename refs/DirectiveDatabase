__NAME__ description
The &conf-__FILENAME__; configuration directive makes it possible to
read all configuration directives from a &glos-database;, instead of
from the usual &ccf; configuration file.
</para><para>
The database can (but does not have to) be previously defined with
the &conf-Database; directive. When it is, then just the table name
is required and honored. When it is not, then the &conf-Database; directive 
will be automatically invoked first to register the new table, possibly with
custom text source file and table type.  
</para><para>
<literal>table_source_filename</literal> defaults to 
<literal><replaceable>table_name</replaceable>.txt</literal>, and
<literal>table_source_type</literal> defaults to <literal>TAB</literal>.
(The arguments are the same as for the &conf-Database; directive itself,
they are passed to it directly.)

Using this directive, it's possible to configure catalogs that have no
&ccf; at all. How ?
