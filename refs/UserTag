__NAME__ notes
Catalog-based usertag will run under <classname>Safe</classname> restrictions
and will only be accessible from the corresponding catalog.
For many purposes, a global &conf-UserTag;s are better. They're not restricted
by <classname>Safe</classname> and are available to all catalogs running on
the server.
