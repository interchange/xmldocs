__NAME__ description
This is just like &conf-Autoload; as it executes an Interchange &glos-macro;
but runs at the earliest possible stage of request processing, which
allows tweaking the session, path, robot status, cookie handling,
authorization, etc.

__NAME__ example: Simple Preload example
This example shows how to not create a session for any but explicitly listed URL prefixes.
<para>
Put the following in &gcf;:
<programlisting><![CDATA[
GlobalSub <<EOR
sub skip_session {
    $CGI::values{mv_tmp_session} = 1
        if $CGI::path_info =~ m{\A/(?:aboutus|contact|info)};
    return;
}
EOR
]]></programlisting>
<para>
Put the following in &ccf;:
<programlisting><![CDATA[
Preload skip_session
]]></programlisting>
<para>
For diagnostic purposes, you can put a footer in your bottom page
template to show the current session ID:
<programlisting><![CDATA[
session ID=[data session id]
]]></programlisting>
<para>
Restart Interchange, then visit various pages. Whenever you visit a page
whose path starts with "aboutus", "contact", or "info", no session will
be assigned, which you can verify by looking at your diagnostic output
at the bottom of the page. This can be useful if you require cookies for
session access, and don't want to incur the overhead of session access
on pages that don't need it.
