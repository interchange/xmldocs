Dump complete Vend::Cfg structure

To dump the complete config structure at will, run:
<programlisting><![CDATA[
[uneval ref=`$Config`]
]]></programlisting>

Also, at &glos-catalog; startup, a file named 
<filename>etc/<replaceable>CATNAME</replaceable>.structure</filename>
will be created relative to the catalog root directory. A complete
configuration dump will be saved there.
