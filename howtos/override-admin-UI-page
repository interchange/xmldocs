Override page from Admin UI with catalog's custom version

At any time, you can copy pages from
the <filename class='directory'>lib/UI/pages/admin/</filename> directory
into the <filename class='directory'>pages/admin/</filename> directory
under your catalog tree, to make custom versions that override the distribution
ones.
You only need to copy the pages you want to override; the rest are automatically
picked up from the usual, default location.
