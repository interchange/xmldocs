Avoid search strings in a href specification

Basically, you should never embed searches in a &glos-HTML; href specification.
In other words, you should never do something like:
<programlisting>
[area href="scan/lf=category/ls=%Hot Dogs"]
</programlisting>

The proper way to go about it, is to use any of the below two methods:
<programlisting>
[area search="
  lf=category
  ls=%Hot Dogs
"]
</programlisting>
or
<programlisting>
[area href=scan arg="
  lf=category
  ls=%Hot Dogs
"]
</programlisting>
That way you don't have to worry about escaping and formatting. Things
are fragile otherwise.
