(Below is as of 4.03, the equivalent in 4.02 is
\[if type=explicit compare="[error all=1 keep=1]"] ... [/if].)

To check errors without clearing them, you can use the idiom:

>    [if errors]
>    <FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR=RED>
>        There were errors in your form submission.
>    </FONT>
>    <BLOCKQUOTE>
>        [error all=1 show_error=1 joiner="<BR>"]
>    </BLOCKQUOTE>
>    [/if]

-->
