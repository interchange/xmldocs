Validate Interchange-produced Markup
</para></question>

<answer><para>
	Validate pages at W3C using &css-validator; or &markup-validator;.
</para><para>
	&IC; does not output any &glos-CSS; on its own, so the CSS validation outcome
	will depend solely on your CSS skills.
</para><para>
	&IC; does, however, output a lot of &glos-HTML; markup.
	<!-- TODO Remove the note when we fix it -->
	That produced markup is, we can say, pretty inconsistent in
	letter case (uppercase/lowecase) and argument quoting.
	In later 2004, and in the spirit of the upcoming XHTML standards, a
	consensus was reached among &ICDEVGROUP; members to start a long-term
	process of converting all output markup to lowercase and quoting all
	arguments using double quotes. (And a significant process has been made
	&mdash; all core files output lowercased and quoted HTML).

	The above does not harm any compatiblity with ancient Web browser 
	programs, and is a nice step towards strict XHTML compliance.

	For the complete XHTML compliance, non-container markup tags should
	be closed with <literal>/&gt;</literal> instead of just
	<literal>&gt;</literal>. 
	We established the &conf-XHTML; config directive which will adjust the
	output markup for the few non-container HTML tags. There's also the
	<varname>$Vend::XTrailer</varname> variable which is <literal>/</literal>
	or an empty string, depending on the mentioned &conf-XHTML; variable value.
