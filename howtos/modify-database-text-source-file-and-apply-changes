Modify Database Text Source File and Apply Changes

With some kind of a DBM &glos-database;, this should be automatic. Changes
to the text source file will be detected on first client access to the
specific database; &IC; will then re-read the text source file and override
the previous contents in the DBM database. See the &conf-NoImport; to disable
this behavior.

With &glos-SQL; databases, the import happens only once (when the
&glos-database; is initally populated with contents from the text source file).
To manually trigger the re-import for a specific database, delete file
<filename>products/<replaceable>DATABASE_NAME</replaceable>.sql</filename>
and &glos-reconfigure; the catalog.
