General Public License.  This means that individuals and organizations,
both commercial and non-commercial, may use &IC; without charge. If

&IC; is not guaranteed to be supported other than by making
full source code available. If it breaks you get to keep both pieces.
However, in practice &IC; is supported by a developer group and
user community at its mail lists,

There are dozens of consultants who make &IC;-based systems their full-time 
work, and there are many more who develop &IC; catalogs and sites.

&IC; is officially available from 
<ulink url="http://new.icdevgroup.org/i/new/download.html">http://new.icdevgroup.org/i/new/download.html</ulink>. If you are not a skilled Unix user and do
not have experience with Unix software installation and configuration,
definitely choose ready-to-use &IC; packages for Red Hat or Debian GNU based
systems. The rest of the notes apply to the manual, tarball installation 
process.
