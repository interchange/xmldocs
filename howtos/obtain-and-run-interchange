&IC; is free of charge, and is distributed under the GNU
General Public License.  This means that individuals and organizations,
both commercial and non-commercial, may use &IC; without charge. If
you modify and redistribute it, there are certain obligations you
must fulfill. See the file <filename>LICENSE</filename> which came with your
&IC; distribution for the full license.

&IC; is not guaranteed to be supported other than by making
full source code available. If it breaks you get to keep both pieces.
However, in practice &IC; is supported by a developer group and
user community at its mail lists,
<ulink url="http://new.icdevgroup.org/i/new/community.html">http://new.icdevgroup.org/i/new/community.html</ulink>.
There are dozens of consultants who make &IC;-based systems their full-time 
work, and there are many more who develop &IC; catalogs and sites.

&IC; is officially available from 
<ulink url="http://new.icdevgroup.org/i/new/download.html">http://new.icdevgroup.org/i/new/download.html</ulink>. If you are not a skilled Unix user and do
not have experience with Unix software installation and configuration,
definitely choose ready-to-use &IC; packages for Red Hat or Debian GNU based
systems. The rest of the notes apply to the manual, tarball installation 
process.

You will need &PERL; version 5.6.1 or higher to run &IC;, and
Perl 5.8.3 or higher is recommended. &IC; requires the modules
in <classname>Bundle::&IC;</classname> plus one of GDBM_File and DB_File.

&IC; can run on Windows with the cygwin extensions,
but it is not supported and there are no known production sites
using Windows. The majority of &IC; sites run on Linux,
but there are also sites running FreeBSD, Irix, Mac OS/X, and Solaris.
&IC; can run on any Unix-like operating system.

&IC; requires that a web server be installed on your system
in the normal course of events.
As detailed previously, &IC; is always running in the background
as a daemon. It monitors either a UNIX-domain file-based socket (located
in the &conf-RunDir; directory) or a series of INET-domain sockets.
The small CGI &glos-link-program; is used to connect to one of those sockets
and provide the link between &IC; and the web server.
(Since Apache web servers are the most popular, in the rest of the HOW-TO
we will talk in the terms they use.)
</para>

<para>
You need to have a ScriptAlias or other CGI execution capability on your
web server to use the &glos-link-program;. (The default ScriptAlias for many web
servers is <literal>/cgi-bin</literal>.) If you have ExecCGI set for all of your
directories, then any program ending in a particular file suffix (usually
.cgi) will be seen as a CGI program.

<para>
Unix domain sockets are not reachable from the Internet directly,
but only locally from a request on your own server. The link program
vlink is the provided facility for such communication with &IC;.
(Note that this does not prevent visitors from seeing an &IC; website,
in only makes it mandatory to run the Web server and &IC; server on 
the same computer).  
This is the most secure way to run your catalog, for there is no way
for systems on the Internet to interact with &IC; except through
its &glos-link-program;.
</para><para>
The most important issue with UNIX-domain sockets on &IC; is the
permissions with which the CGI program and the &IC; server run.
To improve security, &IC; normally runs with the socket file
having &glos-mode; <literal>0600 (rw&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-)</literal>, which mandates that
the CGI
program and the server run as the same user ID. This means
that the vlink program must be SUID to the same user ID as
the server executes under. (Or that CGIWRAP or suexec is used
on a single catalog system).
</para><para>
With &IC; multiple catalog capability, the permissions situation
gets a bit tricky. &IC; comes with a program, <command>makecat</command>, which
configures catalogs for a multiple catalog system. It should properly set
up ownership and permissions for multiple users if run as the superuser.
</para>

<para>
INET domain sockets are sockets which are reachable from the Internet directly.
The link program tlink is the provided facility for such communication with
&IC;; you may also use your browser to talk to the socket directly
if you have it mapped to a catalog with the global &conf-TcpMap; directive.

To improve security, &IC; usually checks that the request comes
from one of a limited number of systems, defined in the global
&conf-TcpHost; directive.
