<para>
Several actions performed by users are recorded by &IC;'s usertracking 
facility, if one is enabled. Usertrack data can actually be obtained from two
different locations.
</para><para>
The first location is &IC; itself, where you tune the &conf-TrackFile;
directive to your needs (such as <filename>logs/usertrack</filename>).
This is the approach used in the &std-catalog; demo.
</para><para>
The second location are the HTTP headers. You can configure the Web server to
write this header into access logs; here's an example for the &APACHE;
web server:

<programlisting><![CDATA[
LogFormat "%h %l %u %t \"%r\" %>s %b \"%{Referer}i\" \"%{User-Agent}i\" \
			%T %v \"%{X-Track}o\"" track
CustomLog /var/log/apache/track.log track
]]></programlisting>
</para>
