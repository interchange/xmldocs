&IC; has several features that enable secure ordering via SSL.
Despite their mystique, SSL web servers are actually
quite easy to operate. The difference between the standard &HTTP; server
and the SSL HTTPS server, from the standpoint of the user, is only in
the encryption that happens kind-of transparently, and the specification
of the URL -- <literal>https:</literal> is used for the
&URL; protocol specification instead of the usual <literal>http:</literal>
designation.

&IC; attempts to perform operations securely,
but no guarantees or warranties of any kind are made! Since Interchange
comes with &PERL; source, it is possible to modify the program to create
bad security problems. One way to minimize this possibility is to record
digital signatures, using MD5 or PGP, of
<filename>bin/interchange</filename>, <filename>interchange.cfg</filename>,
and all modules included in Interchange. Then verify them on a regular basis to
ensure they have not been changed.

Interchange uses the &conf-SecureURL; directive to set the base URL for secure
transactions, and the &conf-VendURL; directive for normal non-secure
transactions.
Secure URLs can be enabled for individual forms through a form action of 
<code>[process secure=1]</code>. An individual page can be displayed
via SSL with <code>[page href=<replaceable>PAGE_URL</replaceable> secure=1]<replaceable>PAGE_NAME</replaceable>&lt;/a&gt;</code>.
A certain page
can be set to always be secure with the &conf-AlwaysSecure; directive.

Interchange incorporates additional security for credit card numbers. The
field <mv>mv_credit_card_number</mv> will not ever be written to disk.

To enable automated encryption of the credit card information, you need
to enable &conf-CreditCardAuto;. &conf-EncryptProgram;
also needs to be set to a command which will, with hope, encrypt the number
when invoked. PGP is now recommended above all other encryption
program. The entries should look something like:

<programlisting>
  CreditCardAuto Yes
  EncryptProgram /usr/bin/pgpe -fat -r <replaceable>sales@company.com</replaceable>
</programlisting>

See &conf-CreditCardAuto;, &conf-PGP;, &conf-GPG_PATH;, 
&conf-EncryptKey;  and &conf-EncryptProgram; configuration directives
for more information and examples.
