Levies in &IC; are a way of defining multiple additional product
charging such as taxes, handling, fees, and shipping.
If you use &conf-Levies;, the normal
salestax, shipping, and handling tags are ignored
(even when you use &tag-assign;).
</para><para>
The &conf-Levy; configuration directive defines individual levy
sections (levy keys). The &conf-Levies; configuration directive
defines which levy sections will actually be honored.
</para><para>
Levy sections (key names) are unlimited and arbitrary; we use
<literal>salestax</literal>, <literal>shipping</literal> etc. to
cover most common cases, but you can put anything in there and have
it work as long as the key names in &conf-Levies; have a corresponding
&conf-Levy; definition.

Levies are a bit processor-intensive, and as such are not recalculated     
every time they are accessed. They can, however, be manually recalculated
by using the <option>check_status</option> &conf-Levy; parameter, 
as described in the &conf-Levy; reference page.
