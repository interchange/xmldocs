<title>Single Forks with PreFork</title>
<para>
Standard &conf-PreFork; uses the typical double-fork method in UNIX for
generating daemons so as to avoid zombies (or more specifically needing
to deal with them). However, forking Interchange daemons is relatively
expensive.

For most (if not all) sane, modern Unixen, you can avoid the relative
expense of double forking by setting SIGCHLD to IGNORE in the master,
which accomplishes roughly the same goal. It states, essentially, that
the parent is not interested in the result of the child's process, so
don't zombify my kids waiting for me to check on them.
