With &IC; 5.3.0, &IC; supports so-called "features". 
The whole purpose of the new "Feature" facility is to allow easy
installation of new capabilities to &IC;.
</para><para>
&IC; already has the convention of "extensions" which allow you to put together
features to add to Interchange. But the installation is manual, and requires
good docs to make it easily installable for end-users. Also, many features
require access to the global configuration.
There's also another problem at sight, namely that of feature creep, since 
everything was just being added to the "&std-catalog;" catalog.
</para><para>
The basic mechanism is simple:
Inside "feature" modules, there are two special kinds of files, called by
extensions <literal>.global</literal> and <literal>.init</literal>.
(In the included <literal>quickpoll</literal> feature, these are named
<filename>quickpoll.global</filename> and <filename>quickpoll.init</filename>).
</para><para>
If a file has the extension <literal>.global</literal>, it is added to the global
configuration. The included <literal>quickpoll</literal> feature, for example,
adds the <am>quickpoll</am> &glos-ActionMap;, and two usertags:
&tag-poll-answer; and &tag-ascii-graph;.
</para><para>

If a file has the extension <literal>.init</literal>, it is run once &mdash;
the first time
the target catalog is accessed. Again, in the <literal>quickpoll</literal> example, it is used to add
<database>mv_metadata</database> entries and a couple of sample polls.
</para><para>

All other files in the directory are catalog configuration
(<filename>quickpoll.catalog.cfg</filename> for a concrete example).
It could have also been
broken up into say, files <filename>quickpoll.sql</filename> and
<filename>quickpoll_answer.sql</filename>.
</para><para>
All subdirectories contain files which are copied to the
catalog directory with the same relative path. In this
case,
<filename>&glos-ICROOT;/features/quickpoll/templates/components/quickpoll</filename>
would go to 
<filename>&glos-CATROOT;/templates/components/quickpoll</filename>.
</para><para>
The <literal>.init</literal> file, when run, sends its output to
<filename>&conf-ConfDir;/init/<replaceable>FEATURE</replaceable>/<replaceable>FEATURE</replaceable>.init</filename>
(and that would be <filename>etc/init/quickpoll/quickpoll.init</filename> for
the concrete example.)
Once it is run, the existence of the file prevents it being run again.
<!-- TODO: Doesnt it always check for existence of the file on (re)start?
When the server is restarted, the file test is no longer needed, as the 
init procedure has already been done.

Currently, the uninstallation procedure is missing.
