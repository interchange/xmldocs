When giving links to your website to your partners, often times you want
to embed an identification string that will link visits or eventual
sales to the corresponding partner.

&IC; supports affiliate tracking; the source of the visit or order
is always accessible using <code>[data session source]</code>.

So when giving links to your affiliates, make sure the affiliate code
you assign them is embedded in one of the following ways:
<programlisting>
http://&def-hostname;/cgi-bin/&std-catalog;/index?;;thesource         (old Minivend 3 way, still works)
http://&def-hostname;/cgi-bin/&std-catalog;/index?mv_pc=thesource     (Interchange way, still works)
http://&def-hostname;/cgi-bin/&std-catalog;/index?mv_source=thesource (current way)
</programlisting>
Note that <mv>mv_source</mv> was added as an affiliate code-passing option
only in &IC; 4.9.x. Before that, affiliate code was passed in <mv>mv_pc</mv>.
The <mv>mv_pc</mv> variable is used as a variable containing a random number
to prevent caching of pages. So if you want to use mv_pc as a way of 
carrying over the affiliate code, it must contain at least one non-digit.
(<literal>mv_pc=A12</literal> is a good affiliate code,
<literal>mv_pc=12</literal> is not). If using <mv>mv_source</mv>, affiliate
code is free of this restriction.

Sometimes you want the affiliate code to disappear from the URL after
the visitors get redirected to your page. To enable that feature, see
&conf-BounceReferrals; configuration directive.
