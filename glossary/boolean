A <emphasis>boolean</emphasis> variable is one that can only represent
a &glos-true; or &glos-false; value.

The variable type was named after

Note that, in Interchange &glos-configuration; directives parlance,
<literal>boolean</literal> is used somewhat awkwardly. Instead of adhering
to above definition of <literal>boolean</literal>, it actually signifies
an &glos-array; in which you can search for the presence or absence of
a value. Real boolean variables are called <literal>yesno</literal>s in
Interchange.

This naming confusion is unfortunate, but is fortunately quarantined
to the configuration directives "space".
