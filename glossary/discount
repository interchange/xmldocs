Product discounts in &IC; can be set at any time. The discounts
apply only to the customer receiving them, so you can gate the          
discounts based on membership in a club or other arbitrary means.

Discounts are are of the following types:

<itemizedlist>

	<listitem><para>
	Discount on a specific item - a discount for one particular item.
	Key to use with the &tag-discount; tag is the product's &glos-SKU;
	</para></listitem>
	<listitem><para>
	Discount on all items - a discount applying to all items.
	Key to use with the &tag-discount; tag is <literal>ALL_ITEMS</literal>
	</para></listitem>
	<listitem><para>
	Discount on a particular item at particular time - 
	a discount for an individual line item, applied if the <mv>mv_discount</mv>
	attribute is set (usually with embedded &PERL;)
	</para></listitem>
	<listitem><para>
	Order discount - a discount applied not on individual products, but on a
	total order.
	Key to use with the &tag-discount; tag is <literal>ENTIRE_ORDER</literal>
	</para></listitem>

</itemizedlist>

The discounts are specified using a formula. The formula is scanned for
the <varname>$q</varname> and <varname>$s</varname> variables which are
first substituted for with the item quantity and subtotal respectively.
The variable <varname>$s</varname> is saved between
iterations, so that the discounts can be cumulative.
</para><para>
In case of individual item discounts, the formula must be defined in a way 
that it produces a subtotal which includes <emphasis>all items</emphasis> of
the same SKU that are found in the user's basket.
In case of an entire order discount, the formula is usually simpler
and defines a flat discount amount or percentage.
