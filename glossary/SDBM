SDBM is an of in-file, non-&glos-SQL; database (similar to GDBM).
</para><para>
&IC; must work with some kind of a database. When no SQL database is 
specified, database source files (text) are still stored in a database,
even though it's a file-based one (GDBM or similar) and requires no
special setup from the user.

For in-file database backend, &IC; will either use &GDBM; or &BDBM;, depending
on what it finds on the system.

Yet another option was SDBM, but it is severely handicapped &mdash; it does
not support values bigger than 2048 bytes and at least two of our demo
catalog databases fail to load for that reason.

Since early 2006, Interchange no longer considers SDBM an option, unless it is
explicitly told so. You can explicitly instruct &IC; to use SDBM backend
for particular databases, but that is not encouraged and SBDM should not
be used.
