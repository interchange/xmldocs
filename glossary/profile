&IC; form <emphasis>profiles</emphasis> are used to validate form inputs and
eventually trigger additional actions. Input fields validation usually contains
of requiring some of the fields to be non-empty or match a specific regular
expression pattern at time of submit.
</para>
<para>
Actions, for example, can be used to signalize the completion of an order
process. Profiles are not specific to order checkout or something; they are
an integral part of all form processing in &IC;. You will also see actions
such as &IC; account creation, login, logout or password change being at least
partly handled using profiles.
</para>
<para>
Profiles can be defined in external files (and activated using 
&conf-OrderProfile;) or in &glos-scratch; variables. External files are,
by convention, kept in <filename class='directory'>CATROOT/etc/</filename> and 
begin with <literal>profiles.</literal>. Multiple profiles
can be defined in each file.
</para>
<para>
<!-- TODO move profiles description to separate file -->
A very simple &glos-hello-world;-like profile example follows:

<programlisting>
__NAME__  test_profile

fname=required
lname=required

__END__
</programlisting>

The above profile requires customers' first and last names to be
entered.
</para>

<note>
<para>
The <literal>__NAME__</literal> and <literal>__END__</literal> markers
must start at the beginning of line, not even whitespace is allowed. This
is very important because the profile would be ignored otherwise.
</para>
</note>

<para>
If users leave some of the required fields empty (or there's some other
reason why you'd want them to correct their input), you'll probably want
to show them the form page again and display some kind of an error
message. To override the default messages, simply specify your own strings
after the format check specification. Here's an example:

<programlisting>
__NAME__  test_profile

fname=required First name is required!
lname=required Last name is required!

__END__
</programlisting>
</para>

<section>
	<title>Format-check Specification</title>

<para>
From the examples above, you can see that the format check specifications are
specified as <literal><replaceable>FORM_VARIABLE_NAME</replaceable>=<replaceable>CHECK_TYPE</replaceable></literal>. Form variable names are obvious; in our
example they were <literal>fname</literal> and <literal>lname</literal>.
Check types, however, can take on one of the following values:
</para>

<itemizedlist>

	<listitem><para>
		<literal>required</literal> - form field must end up with non-empty content.

	</para></listitem>
	<listitem><para>
		<literal>mandatory</literal> - form field must contain a non-blank value,
