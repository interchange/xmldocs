A catalog is the basic functional unit in &IC;. A catalog is to &IC; what
a web site is to a Web server.
</para><para>
Catalogs to configure and offer on the &IC; server are defined in the
global configuration file, &gcf; (or some of the files it includes, of course,
depending on the actual file layout). The definition directive is called
&conf-Catalog;. The directive  you should use to register a catalog is
&mdash; incidentally &mdash; &conf-Catalog;.
</para><para>
Each catalog directory (specified as one of &conf-Catalog; parameters) must
have the file &ccf; in it. For the mandatory directives that need to be
present in the file, see &conf-Catalog; reference page.
