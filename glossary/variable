LI1: Global program variables

If you are programming a GlobalSub or global UserTag, you have access
to all Interchange facilities including all the preset variables and
configuration directives.

The C<Global> package is used to hold variables that are set at
program start and whose value is retained.

The C<Vend> package is used for variables that might be set at some
point during program execution, but that will always be reset to 
undefined at the end of the transaction.

One example is C<$Vend::Cookie>, which holds the raw cookie value
sent by the user. 

If you are going to set or access these variables, you should be
getting your documentation from the source code.
