Cookies are typically short
<literal><replaceable>key</replaceable>/<replaceable>value</replaceable></literal> parts supported by the HTTP protocol. Their importance is in the fact that
the server can send them to clients, and read and modify their value.
In addition, cookies have their expiry time, which can be set, also by the 
server, to any intended value.
Whether &IC; will try to land session cookies in clients' browsers is
determined by the &conf-Cookies; directive, and their default expiry time
is set by &conf-SaveExpire;.
</para><para>
Clients can control whether they reject or accept cookies from all or 
some sites, and can enforce their expiry time.

Web page requests arriving from users are "anonymous" and basically
unrelated to each other even if they are
coming from the same user. This is because the HTTP protocol is "stateless"
and server can't map requests to specific clients based on just the IP
addresses it sees.
Therefore, cookies are a crucial mechanism for preserving state
information in programs with web-based interfaces. By reading the
&glos-session; ID
value (stored in a cookie on client's computer), the server can now recognize
associate users with their ongoing, active sessions.

	<title>Interchange and its non-dependence on client cookies</title>
	<para>
	Many web-based solutions 
	<emphasis role='bold'>require</emphasis> that the clients accept 
	storage and retrieval of cookies. When cookies are not enabled on 
	client side, the usage of the site is limited, or clients are even
	denied access completely.
	</para><para>
	<emphasis role='bold'>
	&IC;, on the other side, does not require client support for cookies.
	</emphasis>
	If the storage of cookies is denied or unsupported by the client,
	&IC; appends session
	information in generated URLs and uses them to continue keeping track of
	user sessions. (An example session ID "embedded" in an URL looks like
	<literal>?id=YjiSdrek</literal>).
	</para><para>
	Session IDs embedded in URLs should theoretically be equivalent	to cookies,
	and they <emphasis>almost</emphasis> are. The drawback is namely the fact
	that once you visit a non-&IC; page, you lose the <literal>id=</literal>
	argument from the URL (because &IC; isn't there to insert it appropriately).
	The end result is the users will lose their session information when they
	return back to &IC; pages, unless they copied the session ID information and
	put it back in the URL manually (which is a bit too much to expect from 
	random visitors). In practice, this isn't a problem when you're
	not sending users out of &IC; space, and when you build the site with this
	fact in mind.

<para>
When a new client accesses its first page from the &IC; catalog, &IC; sends
it both the requested page and a cookie. At that point, &IC; can't
know whether the client accepted the cookie or not &mdash; it has to wait for
the client to initiate the second page request.
(Historically, many application servers always bounced the first request
to provoke the second access from the client and to check for
cookie support. Interchange does not do it.)
</para><para>
If the user sends a cookie back to &IC; (which, as you see, can happen no
sooner than on second request), &IC; knows the client is cookie-capable and
there's no <emphasis>need</emphasis> to embed session ID in URLs.
</para><para>
One possibly confusing thing is that, by default, &IC; always appends
session ID information to the URLs it generates &mdash; even if clients
have no cookie-handing problems.
If the &glos-scratch; variable <mv>mv_no_session_id</mv> is set in the user's
session, the session ID will not be appended to the URL. Furthermore,
on a somewhat related note, if the scratch
value <mv>mv_no_count</mv> is set, then the page count
(<literal>mv_pc=<replaceable>random</replaceable></literal>) will not be
appended either. "PC" is a page counter that serves to prevent client browsers
from caching pages.

<!--
.No session ID or count will be shown. That makes the URL shown above to be http://machine.company.com/cgi-bin/vlink/shirts.html. Once again, this is on the second page the user accesses, if they are taking and sending cookies. If the user has a pre-existing C<MV_SESSION_ID> or C<MV_USERNAME> cookie from a prior session, the effect will be immediate.

.The C<argument> will be passed to Interchange and placed in the C<mv_arg> session parameter. This allows programming of a conditional page display based on where the link came from. The argument is then available with the tag [data session arg], or the embedded Perl session variable $Session->{arg}. Spaces and some other characters will be escaped with the %NN URL-style notation and unescaped when the argument is read back into the session.

.A bit of magic occurs if Interchange has built a static plain HTML page for the target page. Instead of generating a normal Interchange-parsed page reference, a static page reference will be inserted if the user has accepted and sent back a cookie with the session ID.
