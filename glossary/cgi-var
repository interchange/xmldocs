<para>
Interchange server runs as a daemon on an Unix system, and is typically
accessed over a communication socket by a web server daemon. In turn,
the web server is accessed by a client using a web browser.
</para>
<para>
Users can send data back to the web server (and thus, indirectly,
to the Interchange process it contacts) by submitting HTML forms.
</para>
<para>
For the form submission to be meaningful, it must carry some data, which
is organized in <literal>
<replaceable>key</replaceable>=<replaceable>value</replaceable>
</literal> pairs. The submission happens according to the CGI
(Common Gateway Interface) specification.
</para><para>
Those submitted keys (and their associated values) are, now obviously, called
"CGI variables".
</para>
<para>
CGI variables in &IC; are accessible using the &tag-cgi; tag, but
<emphasis role='bold'>only</emphasis>
on a page directly following the form submission. In other words, you can't
use &tag-cgi; to retrieve a variable submitted at arbitrary past time during
an user session - that is possible only using &tag-value;.
</para>
<para>
As CGI variables contain user-supplied data, they are obviously of
great concern from a security standpoint.
