<para>
In password protection, salt is a random string of data (two
characters, in traditional crypt implementations) used to modify a
password hash.
</para><para>
Salt is added to make it impossible (or at least more difficult) for an
attacker to break into a system by pre-compiling large dictionaries of 
password strings and then comparing them to the crypted strings from the
password files. In effect, adding a 2-character salt to a password hash
makes more than 600 possible combinations of the same actual password.
</para><para>
One of the side effects of salt is that it causes an actual password
to generate two different encrypted strings (when two different salts are
used), so multiple users can accidentally choose the same password without
making that fact obvious to any user with read access to the crypted strings.
<!-- Let's keep this trivia hidden ;-)
<sbr/>
A little real-world trivia:
it once happened that, out of about 650 system users, there were two 
pairs of identical passwords. Two people used the password
<literal>franjo</literal>, and two used <literal>dinamo</literal>.
At a later point in time, some other person changed her existing password
to <literal>tinuviel</literal>, which created a total of 3 pairs of 
identical passwords used at the same time.
