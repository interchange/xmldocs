&IC; "form actions" are basically &PERL; subroutine definitions that you can
execute upon form submission. Which form action to trigger is specified by the
<mv>mv_action</mv> form variable.

Successfully executed form action should return a &glos-true; value, upon
which &IC; would display the page specified in <mv>mv_nextpage</mv>.
If the form action returns &glos-false;, &IC; will not display any page.

Using &conf-FormAction;, you can both define new and override existing
form actions.
