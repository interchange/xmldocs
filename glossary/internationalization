Internationalization (or "I18N") features are those being in relation to 
program's ability to support localized messages (see &glos-locale;),
currencies, and other region-specific settings.
</para><para>
&IC; has a rich set of I18N features that allow conditional message display,
differing price formats, different currency definitions, price factoring,
sorting, and other settings. Currently, those features are implemented as
&IC;-specific, and do not rely on &PERL;'s I18N/L10N features, except for
the built-in POSIX support (<code>use locale</code>
and <function>setlocale()</function>).
</para><para>
The definitions are maintained in the &ccf; file, through the use of 
Interchange's &conf-Locale; directive. All settings are
independent for each catalog <emphasis role='bold'>and</emphasis> each user
visiting that catalog; in other words, customers can access the same catalog
in an unlimited number of languages, currencies and regional settings.
