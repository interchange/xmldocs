Pragmas are used to control various aspects of page and data parsing and display. They are processed before an &IC; page goes to the normal processing
routine.

Pragma values can be defined at any level; catalog-wide, page-wide or
&glos-ITL;-block wide.

Catalog-wide pragmas are equivalent to inserting <code>[pragma ...]</code>
on every page. However, setting the &conf-Pragma; catalog directive (instead of
using &tag-pragma; tag all the time) has the benefit of initializing at 
catalog startup time (so, only once),  which avoids extra hash key lookups.
Namely, there is some crossover point at about 4 &PERL; references where it
saves processor power to assign a scalar instead of looking it up every time.

To define a pragma catalog-wide, use the <option>Pragma</option> directive:
<programlisting>
Pragma <replaceable>NAME</replaceable> <group choice='req'><arg choice='plain'>0</arg><arg choice='plain'>1</arg><arg choice='plain'>=<replaceable>pragma-specific value</replaceable></arg></group>
</programlisting>
</para><para>
To define a pragma for a particular page, use the &tag-pragma;
tag anywhere on a page. For readability, however, we suggest to always 
define pragmas at the top.
</para><para>
The following two lines, of which you would 
usually use only one at a time, present pragma activation and deactivation:
<programlisting>
[pragma <replaceable>NAME</replaceable>]
[pragma <replaceable>NAME</replaceable> 0]
</programlisting>
</para><para>
To define a pragma for a &glos-ITL; block inside the page, enclose the
block in <code>[tag pragma ...]</code>:
<programlisting>
[tag pragma <replaceable>NAME</replaceable>]1[/tag]
  ...
[tag pragma <replaceable>NAME</replaceable>]0[/tag]
</programlisting>
</para><para>
Starting with Interchange 5.0, the <code>$::Pragma->{name}</code> syntax
is used in the &IC; source, instead of the old
<code>$Vend::Cfg->{Pragma}{name}</code>.
