<pre>The last "authoritative" statement on code standards was done about a year
ago, and is still on the Akopia Wiki. Basically perlstyle was formally
adopted and a few trivial additions made.

I like the way cuddled elses visually unify the whole control flow. But
even an else-cuddling diehard like me can change, if that's what people
want. :)

Programming Standards

(MikeHeins, JeffBarr, EricZarko, SonnyCook)

The following notes document a meeting that took place on November 14,
2000.

Introduction - We agreed that it is good to have a programming style, and
that the existing style of code should be preserved. We agreed that making
global changes to impose a consistent style is not worth doing. Instead,
we will make revisions as we rewrite code. We will generally follow the
published Perl style guidelines, and we will use 4 character tabs.

Else - We accept but do not encourage the use of the "cuddled else"
construct ("} else {" on a single line).

Lexical Issues - White space is free, and white space around operators
increases readability. Lining up the "=" in a series of assignments can be
used to emphasize the parallel structure.

Naming - Package globals should start with a capital letter. In other
situations, avoid StudlyCaps where names begin with a capital letter.
Items in the main package should be referenced as "$::Foo", not
"$main::Foo".

Globals - Global variables and subs should be used very sparingly.
Occasionally it is necessary to use global variables as implicit arguments
to certain subs for efficiency purposes. We should not add more globals,
and we should consider removing existing ones. An important exception are
certain subs such as logGlobal, logDebug, errmsg, and logError.

CVS - CVS comments should be meaningful. As a matter of good programming
practice, we encourage a careful review of all diffs before committing
changes to CVS. When committinga large number of files (possibly
containing changes and fixes to multiple areas) it is best to create
file-specific comments addressing individual fixes. Using a blanket
comment is not encouraged.

Loops - We prefer to declare loop control variables immediately prior to
the beginning of the loop:

my $var;
foreach $var () {
...
}

Bugzilla - We encourage the use of Bugzilla as a work queuing tool.
Entering and tracking all bugs, even those you find and then fix yourself,
is a good practice. Creating a relationship between a CVS commit and a
Bugzilla entry by listing the bug number in the CVS log message and the
file names in the Bugzilla entry is encouraged.
