Pre-release:

Check WHATSNEW against CVS logs, add release date
Update copyright dates as appropriate if new year since last release
Make sure version numbers are correct in all files:
	README
	README.rpm-dist
	configure
	Makefile.PL
	scripts/interchange.PL
	dist/foundation/products/mv_metadata.asc (ui-version)
	SPECS/interchange.spec
Double-check MANIFEST (create using LC_ALL=C)
Do a clean checkout from CVS to make sure no sticky tags exist in local checkout
Tag or re-tag CVS repository with REL_4_6_3 (or whatever)
Run regression test catalog
Build tarball and note MD5 sum
Build RPMs
Test clean install of Foundation demo, place order, use admin
Build docs tarball & RPMs (for stable releases)
Sign RPMs with personal GnuPG key
Have Racke build and sign Debian packages (using same tarball so MD5 sum is identical)
Have people test the packages
Make md5sums to mention in release notes, and in files on FTP server


Upload tarball, RPMs, README, WHATSNEW to:

root@ftp.icdevgroup.org:/var/ftp/pub/interchange...
Update interchange-latest.tar.gz symlinks for stable releases
Rename README to README.txt so Apache will display it
Rename README.rpm-dist to README.txt in rpm directory
Update WHATSNEW file to latest (no need to keep old ones in same branch, as their contents are still included in the latest file)
