	<h1>A Lesson on ITL Tags</h1>
	<p>
	<br />
<!--
If you're still with us, it means you have managed to grasp those most
general principles of how Interchange features and functions are accessed
from user pages.  It's now time for another cookie - for a more formal
explanation.
	</p>
-->
	<p>
<b>Interchange Tag Language (ITL)</b> is a simple and intuitive way of
accessing
Interchange functionality; that's why we chose it for this <i>introductory
course</i>. Other possibilities include direct Perl programming, ASP-like
syntax and combinations of the above, but we'll explain those at a later
time.
	</p>

	<p>
ITL is a successor to <b>MML</b>, or <b>Minivend Markup Language</b>.
(Up to version 5.x, Interchange was called Minivend). It is of vital
importance that you become familiar with this basic language and its
syntax. As ITL naturally progressed and the ammount of functionality
provided through it grew, it became more and more important to properly
learn the basics.
<a href="http://mark.stosberg.com/">Mark Stosberg</a>
once put up a theory that MML actually stood for <i>Mere Mortals Language</i>,
while you had to be <i>Information Technology Leader</i> to use ITL.
However, it's not as discouraging as it might seem - stick to our firm
guidance and you'll learn the basics without wasting your time.
	</p>
	
	<p>
In a way, ITL and HTML tags are similar - they both take parameters
or attributes, and they can both be standalone or container tags.
	</p>
	<p>
Standalone tag is one that does not have an ending tag (consequently,
it has no "body"). One such example is the [time] tag; simply placing [time]
on the page displays local time:
	</p>
	<p>
[/restrict]
[time]
[restrict]
	</p>
	<p>
Container tags, on the other hand, do have a body. Let's take [filter]
as an example. In [filter&nbsp;op=mailto]root@mydomain.local[/filter],
"root@mydomain.local" is considered the tag's <i>body</i> and placing the
tag on a page produces a <tt>mailto</tt> link:
	</p>
	<p>
[/restrict]
[filter op=mailto]root@mydomain.local[/filter]
[restrict]
	</p>
	<p>
	</p>
	<p>
Besides being good for a container example, the above [filter] tag also
accepted an attribute. If an attribute is required, or can be specified in
positional order - then it is called a <i>parameter</i>. In our specific case,
the <tt>op</tt> attribute of the [filter] tag is both required and
positional, so it is a true parameter. (<i>You can't tell which attributes are
required, positional or accepted just by looking at the tag - you need to 
consult the appropriate tag's reference page</i>).
	</p>
	<p>
	Let's see the named and positional approach to specifying parameters
	and attributes:
	</p>
	<p>
	<ul>
		<li>[filter op=mailto]</li>
		<li>[filter mailto]</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
	It is important to note that you cannot mix positional and named
	parameters - <b>each tag individually must be provided either all positional,
	or all named parameters</b>. Additionally, some tags <i>look</i> like
	container tags when they're not - for example, the closing &#91;/page] tag is
	just a macro and not a closing tag to the corresponding [page] 
	(consequently, the text between [page] and &#91;/page] is <b>not</b> treated
	as the body of the [page] tag.
