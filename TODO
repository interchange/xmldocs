DOCUMENTATION SYSTEM:

 Mid-term:
- Think about adding "online example" (role=html in combination with 
  a flag that says if html is to be static or for hosting on IC-enabled site) 
- for "online" docs, also provide a form where users can add comments or
  ask for clarification. (this could be done with either pure IC (forum?), or 
	XML forms capability)..
- filenames in Source contexts should also be clickable
- in html, make source contexts "rollable" by either using some css
  properties or javascript. this is not really needed when you only have
	say, 15 lines of context, but it'll come great when you have a copy
	of a 300-lines usertag.

 Long-term:
- Support using refs/<filename> with all the documentation for a symbol
  instead of refs/<directory>/<files>.

DOCUMENTATION ITSELF:
- Resolve items from tmp/missing file. (You need to run 'make' in your tree
  first, to get that file generated). I did what I could, now the list only
	contains items which don't even exist in the old docs, so I can't copy/paste;
	someone who is able to write the description/examples from scratch should
	do that.
