DOCUMENTATION SYSTEM:

 Mid-term:
- Think about adding "online example" (role=html in combination with 
  a flag that says if html is to be static or for hosting on IC-enabled site) 
- for "online" docs, also provide a form where users can add comments or
  ask for clarification. (this could be done with either pure IC (forum?), or 
	XML forms capability)..
- filenames in Source contexts should also be clickable

 Long-term:
- Support using refs/<filename> with all the documentation for a symbol
  instead of refs/<directory>/<files>.

DOCUMENTATION ITSELF:
- Resolve items from tmp/missing file. (You need to run 'make' in your tree
  first, to get that file generated). I did what I could, now the list only
	contains items which don't even exist in the old docs, so I can't copy/paste;
	someone who is able to write the description/examples from scratch should
	do that.
