Interpolate/reparse are two options?  adjust ROW_INTERPOLATE_0/1

Great stuff:
For each symbol: keep a list of other symbols IT uses
For example, if I knew that, I could have seen I need to set
DOCROOT for [image] to work.

ADD ROLES FOR OPERATING SYSTEMS/LINUX DISTRIBUTIONS. Documentation 
from Debian package should directly have all proper paths and names.

<Racke>I name three things that IC users often didn't acknowledge:
  namespaces (CGI, Values, Scratch)
  parsing order ([L], variables, lists) - interpolation
  inventing syntax doesn't buy you anything
  IC is _not_ a programming language

Ask ndw about including [NEW!] in titles in TOC.


PRIMARY:
- Stinky manpage stylesheets are a disaster. This time it's that
  <cmdsynopsis> is verbatim and <screen> still renders comments without
  newlines! I mean, what the... (And &copy; is translated to crap instead
  of plain "C"). Will need to write XSLT to fix that, and support tables.
- ./files/ directory is not properly referenced from chunked documents.
- Double-linked SeeAlso doesn't work. ConfigAllBefore points to ConfigAllAfter,
  but the latter doesn't return love.

- In iccattut:
  - make a "translation map" of /etc/interchange/* to RPM-equivs.
  - item for package names, like interchange-cat-foundation, wenglish, etc..
    ( This is ok, docbook 4.4 will have <package> element )
  - explain syntax accepted in profile files
  - Fix ImageDir and include one picture for example

- in source contexts, wrap runaway lines
- match style (no starting verb or all starting verbs) in all Example titles
- check if all Default fields are properly formated (<literal> or none)
- s/a HTML/an HTML/
- script to [un]comment debug lines!!

GLOSSARY:
Say about accesskeys in html source, for key-based navigation
tag, interpolation, reparse, symbol types
catalog/global variable, tag,ui,
action, form,  unix inet socket, values,
regex, flypage, sku, ad, weighted display

HOWTOs:
- how to delete item from cart in all possible ways
- create a menu bar: see bar_button

Programming guidelines doc - integrate with programming style. Advise
programmers of choices to make in order to make their code play well with
IC - for example, if they want to have a field in the DB for images,
advise them to name the column 'image' because other tags (they might or
might not later use) take that as default value. etc...
guide on setting complete IC environment
style: leave newline at end of file
explain version naming.. stable/unstable and how 5.3.0 implies next stable
Documentation on how to create replicated catalog online and at your
desktop machine for ultimate convenience.
- PRODUCE PATCH TO RECOMPILE OFFICIAL DISTRIBUTION PERL without threads.

DOCUMENTATION SYSTEM:
- copy the definition for <example> to a
  new name so we'll be able to differentiate between source chunks and 
  examples.
- Add support to document tags which are NOT found in separate files
  (like [restrict] or [subject]).
- Read all possible options for tag files from vend/config.pm
  (%tag.* structures) and warn if invalid option is found in any tag file.

iccattut:
- give examples for the tasks in 'do yourself' section (in progress)
- give good practices about filtering, security
- see problems from old docs/TODO notes on iccattut
- ICCATTUT MUST NOT STOP WHERE it stops now. it needs to show all stuff
  from current "excercise for readers" section, and also many more things.


 Mid-term:
- for "online" docs, also provide a form where users can add comments or
  ask for clarification. (this could be done with either pure IC (forum?), or 
  XML forms capability, or wiki?)..
- in html, make source contexts "rollable" by either using some css
  properties or javascript. this is not really needed when you only have
  say, 15 lines of context, but it'll come great when you have a copy
  of a 300-lines usertag. Example for this could be taken directly out of
  mwforum demo on mwforum.org
- In refs-autogen at a few places we keep both the hash/array representation
  of values, and their string representation. (We always generate string
  when modifying array/hash). It should be made so that we only modify
  array/hash during the whole program, then in the last step before
  generating the template they get stringified.
- Visually mark obsolete items (those not present in cvs-head)
- Visually mark undocumented items
- Generate leaf nodes (put bin/mkreport back in action)
- Make script which would be like: vim `our.script usertags synopsis`.
  our.script would find all usertags and where their synopsis is defined,
  somewhere in refs/.
- In howtos, include CVS date of items

 Long-term:
- filenames in Source contexts should also be clickable. this is longterm
  because it'll involve perltidy and other stuff I have in mind ...

DOCUMENTATION ITSELF:
- Resolve items from tmp/missing file. (You need to run 'make' in your tree
  first, to get that file generated). I did what I could, now the list only
  contains items which don't even exist in the old docs, so I can't copy/paste;
  someone who is able to write the description/examples from scratch should
  do that.

Taking on ideas from previous ML posts:

** Dan Browning: clustering howto, tuning tips (by Mike),
jedit + IC colorization, commit-to-live script,
Racke: performance docs NEEDED, clustering my mike needs funding or he
won't do it. CVS howto is browning.

Code problems:
- In db_columns: add exlude_columns= parameter?

---
say that code is colorful collection of time and people, so docs try to fill
the gap.
