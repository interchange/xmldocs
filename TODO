- in iccattut, s/item-field/item-param/ at least on some places. 
- Make xmldocs tarball in ftp autoupdated
- Fix file README, directly at the top it talks about prefixes, OUTPUT dir
  etc without introducing it first.
- Change -latest to version number in tarball download

Outstanding:
=======
- Can *_page pragmas take ITL and not just subroutine names?
- See that if 'crypt' is put in see also, all symbols of that name appear
  in see also line and their type is distinguished visually.
- TAXAREA is not discovered in source by bin/stattree
- toc in glossary
- Make MapRoutined source contexts have Line: x-y instead of Lines: z header.
- make glossary,howto items also appear as symbols, so that you can put
  their names in See Also and get generated links
- recognize situations where contexts overlap, but in a special way that
  first example does not see the other, but the other sees the first becase
  of 10 lines of pre-context. (example is IMAGE_MOGRIFY refentry). In those
  cases, resize area of the context report so that it appears as one
- With confs, also include source context where it is being used
- Enhance stuff with acronyms
- Under AUTHORS, include cvs line where appropriate (guides, howtos, gloss... )
- In vars.html, include line if it appears in variable.txt
- why email, email-raw, SendMailProgram produce errors about usertags olink ID
- Add docbook element to reference mailing list posts. Something like
  <ml list='users'>2004-December/041539</ml>, it expands to:
	<ulink url="http://www.icdevgroup.org/pipermail/interchange-users/2004-December/041539.html">2004-December/041539</ulink>.
- match style (no starting verb or all starting verbs) in all Example titles
- check if all Default fields are properly formated (<literal> or none)
- make regexp matching better, to properly scan parse_subroutine(); (gets
  confused by { { in a substitution)
- in refs, replace "database" with "database_name", that kind of things
- import my hand-made test from /var/lib/.../pages/* to appropriate
  ref pages as online examples
- At least in filters, <<EOR messes up the thing, only < is printed and stops

Coding:
- script to [un]comment debug lines!!
- use Interchange.pm to make an Interchange shell (External.pm!)
- finish ML stats <-- MAILPOND on ocelic2! 

DOCUMENTATION SYSTEM:
- Add support to document tags which are NOT found in separate files
  (like [restrict] or [subject]).

TODO: Create a pre-processor for the "docbook/docbookxi.dtd" and
"docbook/olinkdb*xml" files that would automatically discover the path to
the "docbookx.dtd" and "targetdatabase.dtd" files.  Running a find(1) in
"/usr/share" should do the trick on most GNU/Linux OSs, and will remove
the need for distro-specific patches that will quickly grow stale due
to package version number changes.

 Mid-term:
- Ask ndw about including [NEW!] and [TODO!] in titles in TOC. --> This is a 
  bug and it will work when they fix it.
- &glos-hello-world needs to give "hello world", not "hello-world" as text
- List of mv_s, descriptions and shortcuts
- for "online" docs, also provide a form where users can add comments or
  ask for clarification. (this could be done with either pure IC (forum?), or 
  XML forms capability, or wiki?)..
- in html, make source contexts "rollable" by either using some css
  properties or javascript. this is not really needed when you only have
  say, 15 lines of context, but it'll come great when you have a copy
  of a 300-lines usertag. Example for this could be taken directly out of
  mwforum demo on mwforum.org
- Generate leaf nodes (put bin/mkreport back in action)
- If filter returns Vend::xxx::something(), include that function in context
  reports, and try to determine the "Uses" field (which also needs to be
  added to filter refentry template or something)

Tags:
  aliases
  tag call / perl call / mvasp
  container
  has subtags
  nests



Ideas:
- In db_columns: add exlude_columns= parameter?
- New docs:
   - promotional
   - new developer howto
- filenames in Source contexts should also be clickable. this is longterm
  because it'll involve perltidy and other stuff I have in mind ...
- CVS page: http://www.icdevgroup.org/i/dev/cvs.html?id=auxbUMnz
  Make a tutorial : IC from CVS, Catalog in SVN, replicated setup online
  and locally
- How to deal with Safe
Programming guidelines doc - integrate with programming style. Advise
programmers of choices to make in order to make their code play well with
IC - for example, if they want to have a field in the DB for images,
advise them to name the column 'image' because other tags (they might or
might not later use) take that as default value. etc...
guide on setting complete IC environment
explain version naming.. stable/unstable and how 5.3.0 implies next stable
Documentation on how to create replicated catalog online and at your
desktop machine for ultimate convenience.
- Whereever we count things, (like, valid Locale keys are decimal_point, 
  mon_grouping, price_picture,n_cs_precedes etc.) make that information
  derived by scripting in stattree, not manually counting


Notes:
- say that code is colorful collection of time and people, so docs try to fill
the gap.
- say that even though sometimes the code looks ugly/unreadable, check 3 times before thinking it's a bug
- ** Dan Browning: clustering howto, tuning tips (by Mike),
- jedit + IC colorization, commit-to-live script,
- Racke: performance docs NEEDED, clustering my mike needs funding or he
  won't do it. CVS howto is browning.

Misc:
- Mike We are short on chiefs and heavy on Indians here



- In iccattut:
  - Check if redhat/tarball paths are correct
  - explain syntax accepted in profile files
  - Fix ImageDir and include one picture for example
  - <Racke>I name three things that IC users often didn't acknowledge:
    namespaces (CGI, Values, Scratch)
    parsing order ([L], variables, lists) - interpolation
    inventing syntax doesn't buy you anything
    IC is _not_ a programming language
  - how to delete item from cart in all possible ways
  - give examples for the tasks in 'do yourself' section (in progress)
  - give good practices about filtering, security
  - see problems from old docs/TODO notes on iccattut
  - files/tutorial*: s/tutorial-*.log/tutorial.*.log/

NON DOCS RELATED
- Image tag, sort out mgkpath thing



Nice but not fitting the idea
- CVS 'ident' command
- Suppress inline docs (in source)  for items that have xmldocs docs
- In source contexts, for tags, highlight tagCanon and provide <acronym> with
  short explanation and example



In IC source:

- No $Vend::XTrailer on <input>, etc..
- missing </p>s
- lowercase SELECTED/CHECKED ?
