DOCUMENTATION SYSTEM:
- Make docbook/symbol-type-skel/* contents of a glossary, and display a 
  glossary entry instead of those files.
- For tags documentation, have a field if it's a container or not
- bin/stattree, in format_ctx(), see how many spacings all the lines have
  in common, and trim that.

 Mid-term:
- Think about adding "online example" (role=html in combination with 
  a flag that says if html is to be static or for hosting on IC-enabled site) 
- for "online" docs, also provide a form where users can add comments or
  ask for clarification. (this could be done with either pure IC (forum?), or 
  XML forms capability, or wiki?)..
- in html, make source contexts "rollable" by either using some css
  properties or javascript. this is not really needed when you only have
  say, 15 lines of context, but it'll come great when you have a copy
  of a 300-lines usertag. Example for this could be taken directly out of
  mwforum demo on mwforum.org

 Long-term:
- Support using refs/<filename> with all the documentation for a symbol
  instead of refs/<directory>/<files>.
- filenames in Source contexts should also be clickable. this is longterm
  because it'll involve perltidy and other stuff I have in mind ...

DOCUMENTATION ITSELF:
- Resolve items from tmp/missing file. (You need to run 'make' in your tree
  first, to get that file generated). I did what I could, now the list only
  contains items which don't even exist in the old docs, so I can't copy/paste;
  someone who is able to write the description/examples from scratch should
  do that.
