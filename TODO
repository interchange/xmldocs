DOCUMENTATION SYSTEM:
- Make items in the See Also section to appear as links to the 
  appropriate items.
- For reference pages, make Examples appear without the "Example XY"
  prefix.
- See why each Example has weird characters around the example index number
  (it renders badly in manpages).
- In bin/stattree, when extracting symbol context, also try to determine
  function name in question and print its name in Context header (along with
  filename/line number).
- Make more use of docbook/catalog.xml

 Long-term:
- Support using refs/<filename> with all the documentation for a symbol
  instead of refs/<directory>/<files>.


DOCUMENTATION ITSELF:
- Resolve items from tmp/missing file. (You need to run 'make' in your tree
  first, to get that file generated).
