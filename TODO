PRIMARY:
- Stinky manpage stylesheets are a disaster. This time it's that
  <cmdsynopsis> is verbatim and <screen> still renders comments without
  newlines! I mean, what the... (And &copy; is translated to crap instead
  of plain "C"). Will need to write XSLT to fix that, and support tables.
- Contexts: in situation like "symbol \n symbol" where the symbol appears
  multiple times within +- of first occurence, we treat it like one context.
  but the header says 'displaying 2/2 contexts', it doesn't remove
  'duplicates'. fix that.

- In iccattut:
  - make a "translation map" of /etc/interchange/* to RPM-equivs.
  - item for package names, like interchange-cat-foundation, wenglish, etc..
    ( This is ok, docbook 4.4 will have <package> element )
  - explain syntax accepted in profile files
  - Fix ImageDir and include one picture for example

- in source contexts, wrap runaway lines
- match style (no starting verb or all starting verbs) in all Example titles
- Makefile: olinkdbs targets need to have literal depends, not $(shell )
- check if all Default fields are properly formated (<literal> or none)
- s/a HTML/an HTML/
- script to [un]comment debug lines

GLOSSARY:
Say about accesskeys in html source, for key-based navigation

catalog/global variable, tag,ui,
action, form,  unix inet socket, values,
regex, flypage, sku

HOWTOs:
- how to delete item from cart in all possible ways
- create a menu bar: see bar_button

Programming guidelines doc - integrate with programming style. Advise
programmers of choices to make in order to make their code play well with
IC - for example, if they want to have a field in the DB for images,
advise them to name the column 'image' because other tags (they might or
might not later use) take that as default value. etc...
guide on setting complete IC environment
style: leave newline at end of file
explain version naming.. stable/unstable and how 5.3.0 implies next stable

DOCUMENTATION SYSTEM:
- copy the definition for <example> to a
  new name so we'll be able to differentiate between source chunks and 
  examples.
- Add support to document tags which are NOT found in separate files
  (like [restrict] or [subject]).
- Read all possible options for tag files from vend/config.pm
  (%tag.* structures) and warn if invalid option is found in any tag file.

iccattut:
- give examples for the tasks in 'do yourself' section (in progress)
- give good practices about filtering, security
- see problems from old docs/TODO notes on iccattut


 Mid-term:
- Think about adding "online example" (role=html in combination with 
  a flag that says if html is to be static or for hosting on IC-enabled site) 
- for "online" docs, also provide a form where users can add comments or
  ask for clarification. (this could be done with either pure IC (forum?), or 
  XML forms capability, or wiki?)..
- in html, make source contexts "rollable" by either using some css
  properties or javascript. this is not really needed when you only have
  say, 15 lines of context, but it'll come great when you have a copy
  of a 300-lines usertag. Example for this could be taken directly out of
  mwforum demo on mwforum.org
- In refs-autogen at a few places we keep both the hash/array representation
  of values, and their string representation. (We always generate string
  when modifying array/hash). It should be made so that we only modify
  array/hash during the whole program, then in the last step before
  generating the template they get stringified.
- Visually mark obsolete items (those not present in cvs-head)
- Visually mark undocumented items
- Generate leaf nodes (put bin/mkreport back in action)
- Make script which would be like: vim `our.script usertags synopsis`.
  our.script would find all usertags and where their synopsis is defined,
  somewhere in refs/.
- In howtos, include CVS date of items

 Long-term:
- filenames in Source contexts should also be clickable. this is longterm
  because it'll involve perltidy and other stuff I have in mind ...

DOCUMENTATION ITSELF:
- Resolve items from tmp/missing file. (You need to run 'make' in your tree
  first, to get that file generated). I did what I could, now the list only
  contains items which don't even exist in the old docs, so I can't copy/paste;
  someone who is able to write the description/examples from scratch should
  do that.
