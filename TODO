Outstanding:
- Interpolate/reparse are two options;  adjust ROW_INTERPOLATE/REPARSE_0/1
- Online examples only have to be standard examples, with actual work in
  practice if condition=online
  Code to do that is: <programlisting><textobject><textdata fileref="pathto.xml"/></textobject></programlisting>
- Image tag, sort out mgkpath thing
- To be able to build docs for 5.2 (so, excluding cvs-head)
- Fix mess with entities
- Commit log-files howto from denali

- Ask ndw about including [NEW!] and [TODO!] in titles in TOC.

- Stinky manpage stylesheets are a disaster. This time it's that
  <cmdsynopsis> is verbatim and <screen> still renders comments without
  newlines! I mean, what the... (And &copy; is translated to crap instead
  of plain "C"). Will need to write XSLT to fix that, and support tables.
  NEWS: New guy took over xslt maintenance and is interested in improved
    manpage support - he's interested in my problems, and is willing to
    do xslt work himself.
	
- ./files/ directory is not properly referenced from chunked documents.
  This will be done by prefixing links from chunked documents with ../
  "Code" for this is done, I just need to get it from ndw.

- In iccattut:
  - make a "translation map" of /etc/interchange/* to RPM-equivs.
  - item for package names, like interchange-cat-foundation, wenglish, etc..
    ( This is ok, docbook 4.4 will have <package> element )
  - explain syntax accepted in profile files
  - Fix ImageDir and include one picture for example
  - <Racke>I name three things that IC users often didn't acknowledge:
    namespaces (CGI, Values, Scratch)
    parsing order ([L], variables, lists) - interpolation
    inventing syntax doesn't buy you anything
    IC is _not_ a programming language
  - how to delete item from cart in all possible ways
  - give examples for the tasks in 'do yourself' section (in progress)
  - give good practices about filtering, security
  - see problems from old docs/TODO notes on iccattut
  - ICCATTUT MUST NOT STOP WHERE it stops now. it needs to show all stuff
    from current "excercise for readers" section, and also many more things.
  - files/tutorial*: s/tutorial-*.log/tutorial.*.log/

- in source contexts, wrap runaway lines
- match style (no starting verb or all starting verbs) in all Example titles
- check if all Default fields are properly formated (<literal> or none)
- s/a HTML/an HTML/
- script to [un]comment debug lines!!

Programming guidelines doc - integrate with programming style. Advise
programmers of choices to make in order to make their code play well with
IC - for example, if they want to have a field in the DB for images,
advise them to name the column 'image' because other tags (they might or
might not later use) take that as default value. etc...
guide on setting complete IC environment
style: leave newline at end of file
explain version naming.. stable/unstable and how 5.3.0 implies next stable
Documentation on how to create replicated catalog online and at your
desktop machine for ultimate convenience.
- PRODUCE PATCH TO RECOMPILE OFFICIAL DISTRIBUTION PERL without threads.

DOCUMENTATION SYSTEM:
- Add support to document tags which are NOT found in separate files
  (like [restrict] or [subject]).
- Read all possible options for tag files from vend/config.pm
  (%tag.* structures) and warn if invalid option is found in any tag file.



 Mid-term:
- for "online" docs, also provide a form where users can add comments or
  ask for clarification. (this could be done with either pure IC (forum?), or 
  XML forms capability, or wiki?)..
- in html, make source contexts "rollable" by either using some css
  properties or javascript. this is not really needed when you only have
  say, 15 lines of context, but it'll come great when you have a copy
  of a 300-lines usertag. Example for this could be taken directly out of
  mwforum demo on mwforum.org
- Generate leaf nodes (put bin/mkreport back in action)

Tags:
  aliases
  tag call / perl call / mvasp
  container
  has subtags
  nests



Ideas:
- In db_columns: add exlude_columns= parameter?
- New docs:
   - promotional
   - new developer howto
- filenames in Source contexts should also be clickable. this is longterm
  because it'll involve perltidy and other stuff I have in mind ...


Notes:
- say that code is colorful collection of time and people, so docs try to fill
the gap.
- say that even though sometimes the code looks ugly/unreadable, check 3 times before thinking it's a bug
