- See that if 'crypt' is put in see also, all symbols of that name appear
  in see also line and their type is distinguished visually.
- Finish proper formatting for online examples
- Add ROW_REPARSE along ROW_INTERPOLATE in tag refs

Outstanding:
- why email, email-raw, SendMailProgram produce errors about usertags olink ID
- Add docbook element to reference mailing list posts. Something like
  <ml list='users'>2004-December/041539</ml>, it expands to:
	<ulink url="http://www.icdevgroup.org/pipermail/interchange-users/2004-December/041539.html">2004-December/041539</ulink>.
- Ask ndw about including [NEW!] and [TODO!] in titles in TOC.
- match style (no starting verb or all starting verbs) in all Example titles
- check if all Default fields are properly formated (<literal> or none)
- s/a HTML/an HTML/

Coding:
- script to [un]comment debug lines!!
- use Interchange.pm to make an Interchange shell
- finish ML stats

DOCUMENTATION SYSTEM:
- Add support to document tags which are NOT found in separate files
  (like [restrict] or [subject]).
- Read all possible options for tag files from vend/config.pm
  (%tag.* structures) and warn if invalid option is found in any tag file.



 Mid-term:
- List of mv_s, descriptions and shortcuts
- for "online" docs, also provide a form where users can add comments or
  ask for clarification. (this could be done with either pure IC (forum?), or 
  XML forms capability, or wiki?)..
- in html, make source contexts "rollable" by either using some css
  properties or javascript. this is not really needed when you only have
  say, 15 lines of context, but it'll come great when you have a copy
  of a 300-lines usertag. Example for this could be taken directly out of
  mwforum demo on mwforum.org
- Generate leaf nodes (put bin/mkreport back in action)
- If filter returns Vend::xxx::something(), include that function in context
  reports, and try to determine the "Uses" field (which also needs to be
  added to filter refentry template or something)
- icsdf2xml.pl -> =item/=back should be <listitem><para> not, just <para>

Tags:
  aliases
  tag call / perl call / mvasp
  container

  nests



Ideas:
- In db_columns: add exlude_columns= parameter?
- New docs:
   - promotional
   - new developer howto
- filenames in Source contexts should also be clickable. this is longterm
  because it'll involve perltidy and other stuff I have in mind ...


Notes:
- say that code is colorful collection of time and people, so docs try to fill
the gap.
- say that even though sometimes the code looks ugly/unreadable, check 3 times before thinking it's a bug

- jedit + IC colorization, commit-to-live script,
- Racke: performance docs NEEDED, clustering my mike needs funding or he
  won't do it. CVS howto is browning.

Misc:
- Mike We are short on chiefs and heavy on Indians here

Stuff:
- nightly build http://ftp.icdevgroup.org/interchange/nightly_build/
  Also provide interchange-nightly at same place where interchange-latest
- CVS page: http://www.icdevgroup.org/i/dev/cvs.html?id=auxbUMnz
  Make a tutorial : IC from CVS, Catalog in SVN, replicated setup online
  and locally
- Mention ML page, cvsweb
- How to deal with Safe


- In iccattut:
  - Check if redhat/tarball paths are correct
  - explain syntax accepted in profile files
  - Fix ImageDir and include one picture for example
  - <Racke>I name three things that IC users often didn't acknowledge:
    namespaces (CGI, Values, Scratch)
    parsing order ([L], variables, lists) - interpolation
    inventing syntax doesn't buy you anything
    IC is _not_ a programming language
  - how to delete item from cart in all possible ways
  - give examples for the tasks in 'do yourself' section (in progress)
  - give good practices about filtering, security
  - see problems from old docs/TODO notes on iccattut
  - ICCATTUT MUST NOT STOP WHERE it stops now. it needs to show all stuff
    from current "excercise for readers" section, and also many more things.

Programming guidelines doc - integrate with programming style. Advise
programmers of choices to make in order to make their code play well with
IC - for example, if they want to have a field in the DB for images,
advise them to name the column 'image' because other tags (they might or
might not later use) take that as default value. etc...

style: leave newline at end of file
