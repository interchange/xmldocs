- manpages, first line of <screen> loses linebreaks
- work on bin/mkreport
- provide static files for download, describe keys like alt+n
- documentation for bounce and restrict is ignored
- some small error in glossary/pragma at the bottom, [tag pragma]0[/tag]
- see if the files we parse in bin/stattree in block (like parseVendConfig, parseVendInterpolate) allow some stuff to go unaccounted for mkreport
- with tags from Interpolate.pm, context for systemtag is not always 'whole file', but can be x-y as well
- dal autogen preskoci kontekst koji je prazan? i zasto uopce unkondicionalno
  ekspandira @$ctx ako moze da nema konteksta?

- order counter, Session->{mv_order_number}, cronjob -0001, or file da-te.counter, or session_id.time
- in iccattut, s/item-field/item-param/ at least on some places. 
- Change -latest to version number in tarball download
- fix/update AdminUser docs
- aliases like DataDir/DefaultTables are not documented
- unit testing
- remove NEW from <meta>
- In tags, make XSLT code print position number besides "Yes" word in 
  positional parameters for tags
- note in configuration glossentry to use '' to skip values 
- Check ConfigDatabase and DirectiveDatabase. Is description correct? One seems to be wrong
- preprocessor directives in configuration ?
- FAQ should be desintegrated to other places
- what doesn't racke like with WHATSNEW
- replace itemlists with sections or tables
- component tag has wrong source context
Entities to create:
- \0 null char
- table/column/key should be defined in docbook/literals.ent as ROW_TABLE...
- DEFAULT_JOINER_N for \n
- SAFE_DATA

Outstanding:
=======
- Can *_page pragmas take ITL and not just subroutine names?
- See that if 'crypt' is put in see also, all symbols of that name appear
  in see also line and their type is distinguished visually.
- TAXAREA is not discovered in source by bin/stattree
- Make MapRoutined source contexts have Line: x-y instead of Lines: z header.
- recognize situations where contexts overlap, but in a special way that
  first example does not see the other, but the other sees the first becase
  of 10 lines of pre-context. (example is IMAGE_MOGRIFY refentry). In those
  cases, resize area of the context report so that it appears as one
- With confs, also include source context where it is being used
- In vars.html, include line if it appears in variable.txt
- match style (no starting verb or all starting verbs) in all Example titles
- check if all Default fields are properly formated (<literal> or none)
- make regexp matching better, to properly scan parse_subroutine(); (gets
  confused by { { in a substitution)
- in refs, replace "database" with "database_name", that kind of things
- import my hand-made test from /var/lib/.../pages/* to appropriate
  ref pages as online examples
- At least in filters, <<EOR messes up the thing, only < is printed and stops
- &conf-RobotLimit; doesn't link to RobotLimit configuration page

Coding:
- script to [un]comment debug lines!!
- use Interchange.pm to make an Interchange shell (External.pm!)
- finish ML stats <-- MAILPOND on ocelic2! 
- script to manipulate file headers

 Mid-term:
- List of mv_s, descriptions and shortcuts
- for "online" docs, also provide a form where users can add comments or
  ask for clarification. (this could be done with either pure IC (forum?), or 
  XML forms capability, or wiki?)..
- Generate leaf nodes (put bin/mkreport back in action)
- If filter returns Vend::xxx::something(), include that function in context
  reports, and try to determine the "Uses" field (which also needs to be
  added to filter refentry template or something)

Ideas:
- In db_columns: add exlude_columns= parameter?
- New docs:
   - promotional
   - new developer howto
- filenames in Source contexts should also be clickable. this is longterm
  because it'll involve perltidy and other stuff I have in mind ...
- CVS page: http://www.icdevgroup.org/i/dev/cvs.html?id=auxbUMnz
  Make a tutorial : IC from CVS, Catalog in SVN, replicated setup online
  and locally
- How to deal with Safe
Programming guidelines doc - integrate with programming style. Advise
programmers of choices to make in order to make their code play well with
IC - for example, if they want to have a field in the DB for images,
advise them to name the column 'image' because other tags (they might or
might not later use) take that as default value. etc...
guide on setting complete IC environment
explain version naming.. stable/unstable and how 5.3.0 implies next stable
Documentation on how to create replicated catalog online and at your
desktop machine for ultimate convenience.
- Whereever we count things, (like, valid Locale keys are decimal_point, 
  mon_grouping, price_picture,n_cs_precedes etc.) make that information
  derived by scripting in stattree, not manually counting


Notes:
- say that code is colorful collection of time and people, so docs try to fill
the gap.
- say that even though sometimes the code looks ugly/unreadable, check 3 times before thinking it's a bug

- Racke: performance docs NEEDED, clustering my mike needs funding or he
  won't do it. CVS howto is browning.

Misc:

- In iccattut:
  - Check if redhat/tarball paths are correct
  - explain syntax accepted in profile files
  - Fix ImageDir and include one picture for example
  - <Racke>I name three things that IC users often didn't acknowledge:
    namespaces (CGI, Values, Scratch)
    parsing order ([L], variables, lists) - interpolation
    inventing syntax doesn't buy you anything
    IC is _not_ a programming language
  - how to delete item from cart in all possible ways
  - give examples for the tasks in 'do yourself' section (in progress)
  - give good practices about filtering, security
  - see problems from old docs/TODO notes on iccattut
  - files/tutorial*: s/tutorial-*.log/tutorial.*.log/

NON DOCS RELATED
- Image tag, sort out mgkpath thing



Nice but not fitting the idea
- CVS 'ident' command
- Suppress inline docs (in source)  for items that have xmldocs docs
- In source contexts, for tags, highlight tagCanon and provide <acronym> with
  short explanation and example



In IC source:

- No $Vend::XTrailer on <input>, etc..
- missing </p>s
- lowercase SELECTED/CHECKED ?

Community-contributed usertags (was usertag.pod before 4.7.0; too messy)
icstart - Getting Started Guide

http://host/cgi-bin/cat?mv_pc=RESET      (clears it, for debugging)
Otherwise mv_pc does double duty as a cache foiler, and is a meaningless,
incrementing integer.

iccattut:
Switch to new payment settings instead of mv_cyber_mode etc.
To add
Discuss profile.order verification options like 'zip=zip' and then explain why we don't actually use that one much unless it's for a U.S.-only store
Problems?
[on-match] gets used if search returned no results on an empty search string. Why?
Doubled-up CC verification errors:
No error message is given in [error] if required form variables weren't passed at all (vs. being simply empty)
No error message if profiles.order can't be found

Discuss using images (from old mvdocs):
A public Web directory for inline image graphic files is needed. Interchange does not serve the images, only the HTML tags calling them. A useful convention is to place all buttonbars, backgrounds, and icons in the /images directory, with the catalog items located in the /images/catalog directory. Regardless of the directory structure, an I<absolute path> must be used. Relative paths are unacceptable. Use the I<ImageDir> directive, which places that as the absolute path in front of all relative IMG and INPUT SRC, and BODY, TABLE, TR, TH, and TD BACKGROUND specifications.
