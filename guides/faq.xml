<qandadiv><title>How does &IC; work</title>

<qandaentry>
<question><para>
Where are the pages?
</para></question>
<answer><para>
&IC; pages are not kept in normal HTML space. Look in the catalog subdirectory pages. The pages are always filtered through the &IC; daemon before being delivered.
</para></answer>
</qandaentry>

<qandaentry>
<question><para>
Where are the images?
</para></question>
<answer><para>
&IC; is a &glos-CGI; program, and if relative image paths were used, erroneous 
&glos-img; output like the following would have occured:

<programlisting><![CDATA[
<img src="/cgi-bin/simple/../whatever.jpg">
]]></programlisting>

For that reason, by default, &IC; uses &conf-ImageDir; or
&conf-ImageDirSecure; for a prefix used to rewrite image URLs.
In the demo, image
specs that have no absolute path information are prefixed with
<literal>/simple/images/</literal>.
</para><para>
In an &IC; page, this tag:

<programlisting><![CDATA[
<img src="ordernow.gif">
]]></programlisting>

will become this:

<programlisting><![CDATA[
<img src="/simple/images/ordernow.gif">
]]></programlisting>

This tag:

<programlisting><![CDATA[
<img src="items/00-0011.jpg">
]]></programlisting>

will become this:

<programlisting><![CDATA[
<img src="/simple/images/items/00-0011.jpg">
]]></programlisting>

Absolute image paths are not affected. An image such as
<literal>/other/images/whatever.gif</literal> will not be changed.
