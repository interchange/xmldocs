		<title>XML Conventions</title>
		<para>
		Although you will be writing valid XML, there are few conventions
		on top of XML that would be very good to follow:
		</para>

		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem><para>
			Always provide <literal>id=''</literal> parameter to sections that
			get built to separate files in chunked HTML mode (this includes
			the top-level elements like &lt;book&gt;s and &lt;article&gt;s, 
			and first-level subelements, like &lt;chapter&gt;s and &lt;sect1&gt;s).
			</para></listitem>
			<listitem><para>
			All <literal>id=''</literal>s you provide must be named after the
			actual section title, with spaces condensed and first characters
			capitalized. For example, "Introduction to Interchange" would become
			<literal>id='IntroductiontoInterchange'</literal>.
			</para></listitem>
			<listitem><para>
			Use built-in XML commands to link between sections and documents
			where ever appropriate. If you're mentioning a resource for which
			either a separate section or refentry exists in XMLDOCS (or is
			completely external, such as a different website), please properly
			mark that with XML.
			</para></listitem>
			<listitem><para>
			If you have a longer phrase that keeps repeating every now and then
			(and especially if it's also wrapped in some kind of a link element),
			consider adding it as an XML entity to
			<filename>docbook/literals.ent</filename> and then just refer to it
			using the entity name; like you can write &amp;IC; to produce &IC;.
			</para></listitem>
			<listitem><para>
			When ever you are documenting a particular item and you think you need
			to mention some other item's properties there, you're running into a 
			possible problem of spreading the documentation for a particular item
			in many places which can go out of date.<sbr/>
			So please avoid that, make all the details appear only once, and that
			in the most appropriate place (which is, obviously, the original item
			page).<sbr/>
			Therefore, in such cases simply provide a link to the appropriate item
			and describe its behavior or nuances there, on its own page (usually in
			the general "Description" or "Notes" sections).
			</para></listitem>
			<listitem><para>
			Always use spaces instead of TABs (2 spaces for 1 TAB) to indent
			the text that will appear in the
			generated output files (that includes sample external files and/or
			code blocks that you directly include in the document). XML tolerates
			TABs more or less, but doesn't like them. And it also causes problems
			in fixed width outputs, like manpages.
			</para></listitem>
			<listitem><para>
			For XML, you must write tags in all lowercase because there's no
			other way, but please use only lowecase in HTML examples too, and
			make the HTML code xhtml-compatible (in essence, the compatibility 
			comes down to using all lowercase, quoting all option arguments, 
			and closing all tags; i.e.: &lt;img src="..path.."/&gt;)
			</para></listitem>

<sect1 id="Conclusion">
	<title>Conclusion</title>
	<para>
	I believe I have succeeded in making XMLDOCS fairly convenient to author
	new documents and keep them current with time.
	</para>
	<para>
	If we want to make &IC; recognized globally (for which it definitely
	has the perspective, but it's not there just yet), then having a complete,
	up to date, clear and verbose documentation set is something that's
	almost implied.
	</para>
	<para>
	It would be best if all developers would write both the pieces of
	software and the accompanying documentation. However,
	from the past I have somehow seen that you are not too willing
	to write the documentation (or that was because of all the problems with
	the old documentation system).
	</para>
	<para>
	So, the bottom line is that I really want you to write the documentation,
	but I will not impose any requirements on the structure. That means
	you can:
	</para>

	<itemizedlist>
		<listitem><para>
		Update the existing files with proper XML formatting, or
		</para></listitem>
		<listitem><para>
		Update the existing files <emphasis>without</emphasis> properly tagging
		everything. I will be monitoring all commits and I am willing to fix
		all the formatting if you're willing to write the docs in the first
		place. Or, 
		</para></listitem>
		<listitem><para>
		Provide verbose commit messages <emphasis>and state that you will
		not</emphasis> update the documentation, so me or Racke will reformat
		it properly and commit it to XMLDOCS, or
		</para></listitem>
		<listitem><para>
		You can write completely unformated text without even using XML and
		commit it somewhere in the
		<filename class='directory'>pending/</filename> directory. Me or Racke
		would pick it up and properly update the docs. Just please include 
		enough information (be as verbose as possible), so that we have enough
		words we can rephrase and enough information to work on.
		</para></listitem>
	</itemizedlist>

	<para>
	Also, commit any goodies you might have to
	<filename class='directory'>pending/</filename>.
	</para>

</sect1>


<sect1 id='FileFormats'>
	<title>File Formats</title>

	<para>
	<emphasis role='bold'>
	This is an irrelevant section. Read it only if the examples from the
	already written documentation are not enough, and you need some more 
	hints.
	</emphasis>
	</para>

	<para>
	There are few different file types whose structure needs to be specified:
	</para>

	<sect2>
		<title>Guides</title>
		<para>
		Guides use no pre-processing and are written in pure XML. There
		is a simple "preprocessor" script I wrote in <filename>bin/pp</filename>,
		but it's up to you to put the source through it and commit valid XML
		to the CVS. For the usage examples and features, see script header.
		(It comes handy when you're writing large portions of XML from scratch).
		What you can use are, of course - just like in any other XML chunk,
		the XML entities defined in <filename>docbook/literals.ent</filename> and
		<filename>docbook/autodefs.ent</filename>. For manual entity definitions,
		always use the former file; the latter is autogenerated and automaintained.
		</para>
	</sect2>

	<sect2>
		<title>HOW-TOs</title>
		<para>
		HOW-TOs do not use any preprocessing/autogenerating layer either, but 
		are included in the main <filename>howtos/howtos.xml</filename> file, so
		the chunks you write must not be standalone. The parent element you need
		to use is the XML's &lt;chapter&gt; tag, without any XML document type.
		Existing HOW-TOs provide excellent quickstarts.
		</para>
	</sect2>

	<sect2>
		<title>Symbols</title>
		<para>
		Symbols are a little different. In general, the symbol refentry pages
		already contain all the fields, you only need to provide contents for
		them. To minimize overhead, fields have some default headers and footers
		which you then can (and, infact, must) omit from your chunks.
		</para>
		<para>
		You can also create more sections that begin with the same name, and
		are then appended one after another. This is most suitable
		for examples, so see <xref linkend='Example'/>.
		</para>
		<para>
		In general, all files are handled generically and will be included
		if you name them after the appropriate refentry page section that you want
		to modify. Keep in mind that all files (other than the "strong" 
		<filename>control</filename> one, which is available with multi-file
		method only) append instead of overriding existing
		information.
		</para>

		<sect3>
			<title>control</title>
			<para>
			The <filename>control</filename> file contains "key: value" pairs
			on each line. Comments (#....) can be used at the beginning of the line.
			Otherwise, 'value's are left-trimmed and then recorded <literal>verbatim
			</literal>.
			</para>
			<para>
			Note that the values in this file override (do not append!)
			information already known to the generator script (if any).
			</para>
			<para>
			"Keys" can be anything, but some of them have a special meaning (and
			defining any others makes no sense except for future functionality),
			and some of them must be specified because they have no useful
			defaults:

			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem><para>
					purpose: one-line description. No default, must be specified.
				</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para>
					default: default value. This is symbol-dependent (it makes sense
					with, for example, pragmas or global variables). For other symbols
					(say, tags), this is unused.
				</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para>
					missing: A free-form text that is appended to <filename>tmp/missing</filename> entry for a particular item. Good for a per-item TODO list and important notes. While <filename>tmp/missing</filename> is not empty, you must not feel bored :)
				</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para>
					author: specific symbol's/feature's author.
					ICDEVGROUP members are specified like "&amp;docelic;amp;,
					&amp;ICDEVGROUP;", where the username and ICDEVGROUP entities expand
					to a suitable
					strings (full name, and full team name with link currently - this
					is defined in <filename>docbook/literals.ent</filename>).
					If no author is
					specified, the default shows the team name, not mentioning any
					individual specifically.<sbr/>
					3rd party people need to be specified in the same way (
					name and email with optional group name), such as in a silly 
					example of "Mirko Star &lt;mstar@aol.com&gt;". If the person
					is expected to contribute more often, adding an entity in
					the <filename>literals</filename> for him/her is okay.
				</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para>
					ignore: Usually you specify it only if you want to ignore an item
					(cause it not to be autogenerated and visible). "ignore: yes" works
					fine.
				</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para>
					see also: very powerful feature. List related symbol names, system
					commands or other arbitrary items. Non-IC symbols listed get passed
					as-is, IC symbols get rendered with a clickable link to the item
					and the connection is automatically 2-way (if you mention "B" in 
					"A"'s See Also list, the B's list will automatically get A in its
					see also list).<sbr/>
					On items that begin with "&lt;" (that is, on those that seem to be
					formatted already), no special processing is done and are included
					verbatim.
				</para></listitem>
			</itemizedlist>
			</para>
		</sect3>

		<sect3>
			<title>synopsis</title>
			<para>
			The <filename>synopsis</filename> file needs to contain a block
			that depends on the symbol type being documented. Just copy an 
			existing one from the same symbol group.
			</para>
			<para>
			The synopsis must be provided, or the appropriate "missing"
			entry appears in <filename>tmp/missing</filename>.
			</para>
		</sect3>

		<sect3 id='Description'>
			<title>description</title>
			<para>
			This file is meant to contain prose and is pre-wrapped in 
			the &lt;para&gt; tag. If, for the purpose of your description, you
			need new paragraphs, simply use &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt; to 
			separate them, but always omit the starting &lt;para&gt; and 
			ending &lt;/para&gt;.
			</para>
			<para>
			Note that this is only possible because our Perl scripts do the 
			merging before the source XML is passed to the XML tools; if XML
			tools had to deal with this directly, you'd get a "chunk not balanced"
			error and it wouldn't be possible (well, at least not without
			entities).
			</para>
			<para>
			The description must be provided, or the appropriate "missing"
			entry appears in <filename>tmp/missing</filename>.
			</para>
		</sect3>

		<sect3>
			<title>notes</title>
			<para>
			Same as <xref linkend='Description'/>. May be left empty.
			</para>
		</sect3>

		<sect3 id='Example'>
			<title>example*</title>
			<para>
			The example files must contain an &lt;example&gt; element (which 
			usually contains the &lt;title&gt;, short &lt;para&gt; with description
			and &lt;programlisting&gt; with the actual code or syntax to be shown).
			</para>
			<para>
			It is possible (and welcomed) to have multiple example files. They will
			all be added as separate examples, and their order in the documentation
			will be dictated by their alphabetical order on the filesystem
			(the order in which readdir() reads them). Simply name additional files
			following the regex: /example[\-\.\+_:\d].*/.
			</para>
			<para>
			At least one example must be provided, or the appropriate "missing"
			entry appears in <filename>tmp/missing</filename>.
			</para>
		</sect3>
			
	</sect2>

	<sect2>
		<title>Glossary</title>
		<para>
		The glossary skeleton is autogenerated. All you need to do is place
		items in the <filename class='directory'>glossary/</filename>
		directory. Each file there (filename is irrelevant) must contain a
		valid &lt;glossentry&gt; element. See <filename>glossary/pragma</filename>
		for an example.
